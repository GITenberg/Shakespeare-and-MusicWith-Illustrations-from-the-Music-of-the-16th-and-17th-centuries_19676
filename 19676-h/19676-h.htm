<p>1. The original text uses a &quot;fraction&quot; format
for citations to Shakespeare's plays, e.g.:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/cite.jpg" width="92" height="31" alt="citation" title="citation" /></p>

<p>For clarity, in this e-text the &quot;fractions&quot; have been converted
to a one-line citation, e.g., <i>Rom.</i> III,  v, 25
(signifying Act III, scene  v, line 25). Where the original does not
use the fraction format, the citation style has not been altered.</p>

<p>2. The original text sometimes misspells &quot;Passamezzo&quot; as &quot;Passemezzo&quot;
and &quot;viol da gamba&quot; as &quot;viol de gamba.&quot; These have been corrected in
this e-text.</p>

<p>3. The original text inconsistently uses a breve over the e in
&quot;Parthenia&quot; and &quot;Passameso.&quot; For clarity, the breve has
been removed in this e-text, as it is not part of the
usual spelling of these words, and has in fact been omitted from the 1931
revised edition of the book.</p>

<p>4. The music images and sound files in this e-text were created using Finale
Allegro 2005. The original text occasionally uses old-style symbols for time signatures and
rests; these have been modernized in the images.</p></div>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book contains little that is not tolerably well known both to
Shakespeare scholars and musicians who have any acquaintance with the
history of music. It is hoped that it may be of some use to a large
class of students of Shakespeare who have no opportunity to gather up
the general information which will be found here. The author also
ventures to believe that some brother musicians will be gratified to
see at one view what a liberal treatment the great Poet has given to
our noble art. It will be observed that settings of Shakespearian
Songs of a later date than the generation immediately succeeding
Shakespeare's death are not noticed. The large number of settings of
the 18th century, by such men as Arne, though interesting musically,
have nothing whatever to do with the student of Shakespeare and the
circumstances of his time. It can only be regretted <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>that so much of
the original music seems to have perished.</p>

<p>The author is greatly indebted to Mr Aldis Wright, who has kindly
looked through the work in MS., and contributed one or two interesting
notes, which are acknowledged in the proper place.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[I am indebted for the arrangement of this picture to the kindness of
the authorities at South Kensington Museum, where all these
instruments may be found, except the Pipe and Cornet, which belong to
my friend, Mr W.F.H. Blandford.]</p></div>


<p style="text-align: center"><i>In the middle, on table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen Elizabeth's 'Virginal.'</span> Date, latter half of 16th century.
Outside of case (not visible in picture) covered with red velvet.
Inside finely decorated. Has three locks. Is more properly a Spinet,
the case not being square, but of the usual Spinet shape&#8212;viz., one
long side (front view), and four shorter ones forming a rough
semi-circle at back.</p>


<p style="text-align: center"><i>Top row, counting from the right.</i></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Tabor-pipe</span>. Modern, but similar to the Elizabethan instrument.
French name, 'galoubet.' Merely a whistle, cylindrical bore, and 3
holes, two in front, one (for thumb) behind. The scale is produced on
the basis of the 1st harmonic&#8212;thus 3 holes are sufficient. It was
played with left hand only, the tabor being hung to the left wrist,
and beaten with a stick in the right hand. Length <i>over all</i> of pipe
in picture, 1 ft. 2-1/2 in.; speaking length, 1 ft. 1-1/8 in.; lowest
note in use, B flat above treble staff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> Mersennus (1648), however,
says the tabor-pipe was in G, which makes it larger than the one in
the picture. A contemporary woodcut (in Calmour's 'Fact and Fiction
about Shakespeare') of William Kemp, one of Shakespeare's
fellow-actors, dancing the Morris, to tabor and pipe, makes the pipe
as long as from mouth to waist&#8212;viz., about 18 inches, which agrees
with Mersennus. A similar woodcut in 'Orch&#233;sographie' makes the pipe
even longer. Both represent pipe as conical, like oboe. The length of
the tabor, in these two woodcuts, seems to be about 1 ft. 9 in., and
the breadth, across the head, 9 or 10 in. No snare in the English
woodcut, but the French one has a snare.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Cornet</span> (treble), date 16th or 17th century. Tube slightly curved,
external shape octagonal, bore conical. Cupped mouthpiece of horn, 6
holes, and one behind for thumb. Lowest note, A under treble staff.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Recorder</span>. Large beak-flute of dark wood. Three joints, not
including beak. The beak has a hole at the back, covered with a thin
skin, which vibrates and gives a slight reediness to the tone. The
usual 6 finger holes in front, a thumb hole behind, and a
right-or-left little-finger hole in lowest joint.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Small French Treble Viol</span>, 17th century. <i>Back view</i>, same shape as
of all other viols of whatever size. 6 strings, 4 frets.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Treble Viol</span>, as used in England and Italy; label inside&#8212;Andreas
(?) Amati, Cremona, 1637. <i>Side</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> <i>view</i>, shews carved head and flat
back. 6 strings, 4 frets, ivory nut.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Tenor Viol</span>. English, late 17th century. <i>Front view</i>, shewing
sloping shoulders. 6 strings, 7 frets, plain head.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Viol da Gamba Bow</span>. Ancient shape. No screw. This shape in use later
than 1756.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Violoncello Bow</span>. Modern shape, with screw.</p>


<p style="text-align: center"><i>Bottom row, counting from left.</i></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Bass Viol</span>, or <span class="smcap">Viol da Gamba</span>, or <span class="smcap">Division Viol</span>. Italian, 1600.
Carved head, inlaid fingerboard, carved and inlaid tailpiece. 6
strings, 7 frets.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Lute</span>. Italian, 1580. Three plain holes in belly, obliquely.
Ornamental back. Flat head. Pegs turned with key from behind. 12
strings&#8212;viz., 1 single (treble), 4 doubles, 1 single, and 2 singles
off the fingerboard (basses). 10 frets.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Arch Lute</span>. Italian, 17th century. 18 strings, 8 on lower neck, 10
on higher, off the fingerboard. The latter are 'basses,' and probably
half of them duplicates. 7 frets on neck, 5 more on belly.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A principal</span> character of the works of a very great author is, that in
them each man can find that for which he seeks, and in a form which
includes his own view.</p>

<p>With Shakespeare, as one of the greatest of the great, this is
pre-eminently the case. One reader looks for simply dramatic interest,
another for natural philosophy, and a third for morals, and each is
more than satisfied with the treatment of his own special subject.</p>

<p>It is scarcely a matter of surprise, therefore, that the musical
student should look in Shakespeare for music, and find it treated of
from several points of view, completely and accurately.</p>

<p>This is the more satisfactory, as no subject in literature has been
treated with greater scorn for accuracy, or general lack of real
interest, than this of music.</p>

<p>This statement will admit of comparatively few exceptions, one of
which must here be mentioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>The author of &quot;John Inglesant,&quot; Mr Shorthouse, whether he &quot;crammed&quot;
his music or not, has in that book given a lively and quite accurate
picture of the art as practised about Charles I.'s time.</p>

<p>There is no need here to name the many well-known writers who have
spoken of music with a lofty disregard for facts and parade of
ignorance which, displayed in any other matter, would have brought on
them the just contempt of any reviewer.</p>

<p>The student of music in Shakespeare is bound to view the subject in
two different ways, the first purely historical, the second (so to
speak) psychological.</p>

<p>As for the first, the most superficial comparison of the plays alone,
with the records of the practice and social position of the musical
art in Elizabethan times, shews that Shakespeare is in every way a
trustworthy guide in these matters; while, as for the second view,
there are many most interesting passages which treat of music from the
emotional standpoint, and which clearly shew his thorough personal
appreciation of its higher and more spiritual qualities.</p>

<p>Hamlet tells us, and we believe, often without clearly understanding,
that players are <i>the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time</i>, and
that the end of playing, both at the first and now, was, and is, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
hold the mirror up to nature, and <i>to shew the very age and body of
the time, his form and pressure</i>.</p>

<p>The study of this one feature of the &quot;age and body&quot; of Shakespeare's
time, with the view of clearly grasping the extreme accuracy of the
&quot;abstract and brief chronicle&quot; to be found in his works, will surely
go some way to give definiteness and force to our ideas of
Shakespeare's magnificent grip of all other phases of thought and of
action.</p>

<p>The argument recommends itself&#8212;&quot;If he is trustworthy in this subject,
he is trustworthy in all.&quot;</p>

<p>To a professional reader at all events, it argues very much indeed in
a writer's favour, that the &quot;layman&quot; has managed to write the simplest
sentence about a specialty, without some more or less serious blunder.</p>

<p>Finally, no Shakespeare student will deny that some general help is
necessary, when Schmidt's admirable Lexicon commits itself to such a
misleading statement as that a virginal is a kind of small pianoforte,
and when a very distinguished Shakespeare scholar has allowed a
definition of a viol as a six-stringed guitar to appear in print under
his name.</p>

<p>Out of thirty-seven plays of Shakespeare, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> are no less than
thirty-two which contain interesting references to music and musical
matters <i>in the text itself</i>. There are also over three hundred stage
directions which are musical in their nature, and these occur in
thirty-six out of thirty-seven plays.</p>

<p>The musical references in the text are most commonly found in the
comedies, and are generally the occasion or instrument of
word-quibbling and witticisms; while the musical stage directions
belong chiefly to the tragedies, and are mostly of a military nature.</p>

<p>As it is indispensable that the student of Shakespeare and Music
should have a clear idea of the social status and influence of music
in Shakespearian times, here follows a short sketch of the history of
this subject, which the reader is requested to peruse with the
deliberate object of finding every detail confirmed in Shakespeare's
works.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Music in Social Life</span>.</h3>

<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Temp., 16th and 17th centuries.</i>)</p>

<p>Morley, &quot;Plain and Easy Introduction to Practical Music,&quot; 1597, pp. 1
and 2. Here we read of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> dinner-party, or &quot;banket,&quot; at which the
conversation was entirely about music. Also&#8212;after supper&#8212;<i>according
to custom</i>&#8212;&quot;parts&quot; were handed round by the hostess. Philomathes has
to make many excuses as to his vocal inability, and finally is obliged
to confess that he cannot sing at all. At this the rest of the company
&quot;wonder&quot;&#8212;and some whisper to their neighbours, &quot;How was he brought
up?&quot; Phil. is ashamed&#8212;and goes to seek Gnorimus the music-master. The
master is surprised to see him&#8212;as Phil. has heretofore distinguished
himself by inveighing against music as a &quot;corrupter of good manners,
and an allurement to vices.&quot; Phil.'s experience of the supper-party
has so far changed his views that he wishes as soon as may be to
change his character of Stoic for that of Pythagorean. Thereupon the
master begins to teach him from the very beginning, &quot;as though he were
a child.&quot;</p>

<p>Then follows a long lesson&#8212;which is brought to an end by Philomathes
giving farewell to the master as thus&#8212;&quot;Sir, I thanke you, and meane
so diligently to practise till our next meeting, that then I thinke I
shall be able to render you a full account of all which you have told
me, till the which time I wish you such contentment of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> and ease
of body as you desire to yourselfe (Master's health had been very bad
for long enough) or mothers use to wish to their children.&quot; The Master
replies&#8212;&quot;I thanke you: and assure your selfe it will not be the
smallest part of my contentment to see my schollers go towardly
forward in their studies, which I doubt not but you will doe, if you
take but reasonable pains in practise.&quot;</p>

<p>Later on in the Third Part (p. 136) Phil.'s brother Polymathes comes
with him to Gnorimus for a lesson in Descant&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, the art of
extemporaneously adding a part to the written plainsong.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This
brother had had lessons formerly from a master who carried a plainsong
book in his pocket, and caused him to do the like; &quot;and so walking in
the fields, hee would sing the plaine song, and cause me to sing the
descant, etc.&quot; Polymathes tells us also that his master had a friend,
a descanter himself, who used often to drop in&#8212;but &quot;never came in my
maister's companie ... but they fell to contention.... What? (saith
the one), you keepe not time in your proportions: you sing them false
(saith the other), what proportion is this? (saith hee),
sesqui-<i>paltery</i> (saith the other): nay (would the other say), you
sing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> you know not what, it shoulde seeme you came latelie from a
Barber's shop, where you had <i>Gregory Walker</i> (derisive name for
'quadrant pavan,' 'which was most common 'mongst the Barbars and
Fidlers') or a <i>curranta</i> plaide in the new proportions by them lately
found out, called sesqui-<i>blinda</i>, and sesqui-<i>harken-after</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>[These mocking terms, sesqui-<i>paltery</i>, sesqui-<i>blinda</i>, and
sesqui-<i>harken-after</i>, are perversions of names of &quot;proportions&quot; used
in the 16th century&#8212;as, sesqui-<i>altera</i> (3 equal notes against 2).]</p>

<p>We find, on p. 208, that both Philomathes and Polymathes are young
University gentlemen&#8212;looking forward hereafter to be &quot;admitted to the
handling of the weightie affaires of the common wealth.&quot;</p>

<p>The lessons end with their request to the master to give them &quot;some
songes which may serve both to direct us in our compositions, and by
singing them recreate us after our more serious studies.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus we find that in Elizabeth's reign it was the &quot;custom&quot; for a
lady's guests to sing unaccompanied music from &quot;parts,&quot; after supper;
and that inability to take &quot;a part&quot; was liable to remark from the rest
of the company, and indeed that such inability cast doubt on the
person having any title to education at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>We find that one music master was accustomed to have his gentleman
pupils so constantly &quot;in his company&quot; that they would practise their
singing while &quot;walking in the fields.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally&#8212;that part-singing from written notes, and also the extempore
singing of a second part (descant) to a written plainsong, was a
diversion of such young University gentlemen, and was looked on as a
proper form of recreation after hard reading.</p>

<p>In the 16th century music was considered an <i>essential</i> part of a
clergyman's education. A letter from Sir John Harrington to Prince
Henry (brother of Charles I.) about Dr John Still, Bishop of Bath and
Wells in 1592, says that no one &quot;could be admitted to <i>primam
tonsuram</i>, except he could first <i>bene le bene con bene can</i>, as they
called it, which is to read well, to conster [construe] well, and to
<i>sing well</i>, in which last he hath good judgment.&quot; [The three <i>bene's</i>
are of course <i>le-gere, con-struere, can-tare</i>.]</p>

<p>Also, according to Hawkins (History of Music, p. 367), the statutes of
Trinity College, Cambridge, founded by Henry VIII., make part of the
Examination of Candidates for Fellowships to be in &quot;Quid in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> Cantando
possint&quot;; indeed, <i>all members were supposed capable of singing a part
in choir service</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>(Long before this, in 1463, Thomas Saintwix, <i>doctor in music</i>, was
elected Master of King's College, Cambridge.)</p>

<p>Accordingly, we find Henry VIII., who, as a younger brother, was
intended for the Church, and eventually for the See of Canterbury, was
a good practical musician. Erasmus says he composed offices for the
church. An anthem, &quot;O Lord, the maker of all things,&quot; is ascribed to
him; and Hawkins gives a motet in three parts by the king, &quot;Quam
pulchra es.&quot;</p>

<p>Chappell's Old English Popular Music gives a passage from a letter of
Pasqualigo the Ambassador-extraordinary, dated about 1515, which says
that Henry VIII. &quot;plays well on the lute and virginals, sings from
book at sight,&quot; etc. Also in Vol. I. are given two part-songs by the
king, 'Pastyme with good companye' and 'Wherto shuld I expresse.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>A somewhat unclerical amusement of Henry VIII.'s is related by Sir
John Harrington (temp. James I.). An old monkish rhyme, &quot;The Blacke
Saunctus, or Monkes Hymn to Saunte Satane,&quot; was set to music in a
canon of three parts by Harrington's father (who had married a natural
daughter of Henry VIII.); and King Henry was used &quot;in pleasaunt moode
to sing it.&quot; For the music and words, see Hawkins, pp. 921 and 922.</p>

<p>Anne Boleyn was an enthusiastic musician, and, according to Hawkins,
&quot;doted on the compositions of Jusquin and Mouton, and had collections
of them made for the private practice of herself and her maiden
companions.&quot;</p>

<p>It appears from the Diary of King Edward VI. that he was a musician,
as he mentions playing on the lute before the French Ambassador as one
of the several accomplishments which he displayed before that
gentleman, July 19th, 1551.</p>

<p>There is also a letter from Queen Catherine (of Arragon), the mother
of Queen Mary, in which she exhorts her &quot;to use her virginals and
lute, if she has any.&quot;</p>

<p>As for Elizabeth, there is abundant evidence that she was a good
virginal player.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The best known MS. collection of virginal music (that in the
Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge) has at least always been known as
Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book, and the following quaint story is
quoted by Hawkins from Melvil's Memoirs (Lond. 1752).</p>

<p>&quot;The same day, after dinner, my Lord of Hunsdean drew me up to a quiet
gallery that I might hear some music (but he said he durst not avow
it), where I might hear the queen play upon the virginals. After I had
hearkened a while I took by [aside] the tapestry that hung before the
door of the chamber, and stood a pretty space, hearing her play
excellently well; but she left off immediately so soon as she turned
her about and saw me. She appeared to be surprised to see me, and came
forward, seeming to strike me with her hand, alledging she was not
used to play before men, but when she was solitary to shun
melancholy.&quot; [Queen Elizabeth's Virginal is in South Kensington
Museum.]</p>

<p>To go on with the Royal musicians (who are interesting as such,
because their habit <i>must have set the fashion of the day</i>), in James
I.'s reign we find that Prince Charles learnt the Viol da Gamba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> from
Coperario (<i>i.e.</i>, John Cooper). Also Playford (temp. Charles II.)
says of Charles I. that the king &quot;often appointed the service and
anthems himself&quot; in the Royal Chapel; &quot;and would play his part exactly
well on the bass-violl,&quot;&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, the viol da gamba.</p>

<p>George Herbert, who was by birth a courtier, found in music &quot;his
chiefest recreation,&quot; &quot;and did himself compose many divine hymns and
anthems, which he set and sung to his lute or viol.... His love to
music was such, that he went usually twice every week ... to the
cathedral church in Salisbury; and at his return would say that his
time spent in prayer and cathedral music elevated his soul, and was
his heaven upon earth.&quot; But not only was the poet-priest a lover of
church music, for (Walton's Life goes on) &quot;before his return thence to
Bemerton, he would usually <i>sing and play his part at an appointed
private music meeting</i>.&quot; This was fourteen years after Shakespeare's
death.</p>

<p>Anthony Wood, who was at Oxford University in 1651, gives a most
interesting account of the practice of chamber music for viols (and
even violins, which, by Charles II.'s time, had superseded the feebler
viols) in Oxford. In his Life, he mentions that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> &quot;the gentlemen in
privat meetings, which A.W. frequented, play'd three, four, and five
Parts with Viols, as, Treble-Viol, Tenor, Counter-Tenor, and Bass,
with an Organ, Virginal, or Harpsicon joyn'd with them: and they
esteemed a Violin to be an Instrument only belonging to a common
Fidler, and could not endure that it should come among them, for feare
of making their Meetings to be vaine and fidling.&quot; Wood went to a
<i>weekly meeting</i> of musicians in Oxford. Amongst those whom he names
as &quot;performing their parts&quot; are four Fellows of New College, a Fellow
of All Souls, who was &quot;an admirable Lutenist,&quot; &quot;Ralph Sheldon, Gent.,
a Rom. Catholick ... living in Halywell neare Oxon., admired for his
smooth and admirable way in playing on the Viol,&quot; and a Master of Arts
of Magdalen, who had a weekly meeting at his own college. Besides the
amateurs, there were eight or nine professional musicians who
frequented these meetings. This was in 1656, and in 1658 Wood gives
the names of over sixteen other persons, with whom he used to play and
sing, all of whom were Fellows of Colleges, Masters of Arts, or at
least members of the University. Amongst them was &quot;Thom. Ken of New
Coll., a Junior&quot; (afterwards Bishop Ken, one of the seven bishops who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
were deprived at the Revolution), who could &quot;sing his part.&quot; All the
rest played either viol, violin, organ, virginals, or harpsichord, or
were &quot;songsters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;These did frequent the Weekly Meetings, and <i>by the help of public
Masters of Musick</i>, who were mixed with them, they were much
improved.&quot;</p>

<p>There seems to have been little that was not pure enjoyment in these
meetings. Only two persons out of the thirty-two mentioned seem to
have had any undesirable quality&#8212;viz., Mr Low, organist of Christ
Church, who was &quot;a <i>proud</i> man,&quot; and &quot;could not endure any common
Musitian to come to the meeting;&quot; and &quot;Nathan. Crew, M.A., Fellow of
Linc. Coll., a Violinist and Violist, <i>but alwaies played out of
Tune</i>.&quot; This last gentleman was afterwards Bishop of Durham.</p>

<p>Thus we find that in the 16th and 17th centuries a practical
acquaintance with music was a regular part of the education of both
sovereign, gentlemen of rank, and the higher middle class.</p>

<p>We find Henry VIII. composing church music, and at the same time
enjoying himself singing in the three-part canon composed by his
friend, a gentleman of rank.</p>

<p>We find that a Fellow of Trinity at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> was expected to
sing &quot;his part&quot; in chapel as a matter of course. We find Edward VI.,
Mary, and Elizabeth to have all been capable players on lute or
virginals. We find that it was the merest qualification that an
Elizabethan bishop should be able to sing well; and that young
University gentlemen of birth thought it nothing out of the way to
learn all the mysteries of both prick-song (a <i>written</i> part) and
descant (an <i>extempore</i> counterpoint), and to solace their weary hours
by singing &quot;in parts.&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately after Shakespeare's time, we find a courtier of James I.,
and the ill-fated Prince Charles himself, both enthusiasts in both
church and chamber music; and lastly, two years after the Regicide, we
find the University of Oxford to have been a perfect hotbed of musical
cultivation. Men who afterwards became Bishops, Archdeacons,
Prebendaries, besides sixteen Fellows of Colleges, and sundry
gentlemen of family, were not ashamed to practise chamber music and
singing to an extent which really has no parallel whatever nowadays.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence, though more indirect in kind, that the
lower classes were as enthusiastic about music as the higher. A large
number of passages in contemporary authors shows clearly that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> singing
in parts (especially of &quot;catches&quot;) was a common amusement with
blacksmiths, colliers, cloth-workers, cobblers, tinkers, watchmen,
country parsons, and soldiers.</p>

<p>In <i>Damon and Pithias</i>, 1565, Grimme, the <i>collier</i>, sings &quot;a bussing
[buzzing] base,&quot; and two of his friends, Jack and Will, &quot;quiddel upon
it,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, they sing the tune and words, while he buzzes the burden.</p>

<p>Peele's <i>Old Wives Tale</i>, 1595, says, &quot;This <i>smith</i> leads a life as
merry as a king; Sirrah Frolic, I am sure you are not without some
<i>round</i> or other; no doubt but Clunch [the smith] can <i>bear his
part</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Samuel Harsnet, in his <i>Declaration of Egregious Impostures</i>, 1603,
mentions a 'merry catch,' 'Now God be with old Simeon' (for which see
Rimbault's Rounds, Canons, and Catches of England), which he says was
sung by <i>tinkers</i> 'as they sit by the fire, with a pot of good ale
between their legs.'</p>

<p>And in <i>The Merry Devill of Edmonton</i>, 1631, there is a comical story
of how Smug <i>the miller</i> was <i>singing a catch</i> with the <i>merry Parson</i>
in an alehouse, and how they 'tost' the words &quot;<i>I'll ty my mare in thy
ground</i>,&quot; 'so long to and fro,' that Smug forgot he was singing a
catch, and began to quarrel with the Parson, 'thinking verily, he had
meant (as he said in his song) to <i>ty his mare in his ground</i>.'</p>

<p>Finally, in <i>Pammelia</i>, a collection of Rounds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> Catches of 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 parts, edited by Thomas Ravenscroft, and
published in 1609, there is a curious preface, which states that
'Catches are so <i>generally affected</i> ... because they are so consonant
to <i>all ordinary musical capacity</i>, being such, indeed, as all such
<i>whose love of musick exceeds their skill</i>, cannot but commend.' The
preface further asserts that the book is 'published only <i>to please
good company</i>.'</p>

<p>To go on to <i>instrumental</i> music among the lower classes of
Elizabethan and Shakespearian times; there is an allusion in the above
quoted passage from Morley (1597) to the habit of playing on an
instrument in a barber's shop while waiting one's turn to be shaved.
This is also referred to in Ben Jonson's <i>Alchemist</i> and <i>Silent
Woman</i>. In the latter play, Cutberd the barber has recommended a wife
to Morose. Morose finds that instead of a mute helpmate he has got one
who had 'a tongue with a tang,' and exclaims 'that cursed <i>barber</i>! I
have married his <i>cittern</i> that is common to all men': meaning that as
the barber's cittern was always being played, so his wife was always
talking.</p>

<p>There is a poem of the 18th century which speaks of the old times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>However true that may have been&#8212;at all events it is certain that in
the 16th and 17th centuries it was customary to hear instrumental
music in a barber's shop, generally of a cittern, which had four
strings and frets, like a guitar, and was thought a vulgar
instrument.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Another use of instrumental music was to entertain the guests in a
tavern. A pamphlet called <i>The Actor's Remonstrance</i>, printed 1643,
speaks of the <i>decay</i> of music in taverns, which followed the closing
of theatres in 1642, as follows:&#8212;&quot;Our music, that was held so
delectable and precious [<i>i.e.</i>, in Shakespeare's times], that <i>they
scorned to come to a tavern under twenty shillings</i> salary <i>for two
hours</i>, now wander [<i>i.e.</i>, 1643] with their instruments under their
cloaks&#8212;I mean, such as have any&#8212;into all houses of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> fellowship,
saluting every room where there is company with, 'Will you have any
music, gentlemen?'&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, in Gosson's &quot;Short Apologie of the Schoole of Abuse,&quot; 1587,
we find that &quot;London is so full of unprofitable pipers and fiddlers,
that a man can no sooner enter a tavern, than two or three cast of
them hang at his heels, to give him a dance before he depart.&quot; These
men sang ballads and catches as well. Also they played during dinner.
Lyly says&#8212;&quot;Thou need no more send for a fidler to a feast, than a
beggar to a fair.&quot;</p>

<p>All this leads to the just conclusion, that if ever a country deserved
to be called 'musical,' that country was England, in the 16th and 17th
centuries. King and courtier, peasant and ploughman, each could 'take
his part,' with each music was a part of his daily life; while so far
from being above knowing the difference between a minim and a
crotchet, a gentleman would have been ashamed not to know it.</p>

<p>In this respect, at any rate, the 'good old days' were indeed better
than those that we now see. Even a <i>public-house song</i> in Elizabeth's
day was a canon in three parts, a thing which could only be managed
'first time through' nowadays by the very first rank of professional
singers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now proceed to consider some representative passages of Shakespeare

Serenades and other domestic 'Music,' (5) Dances and Dancing, (6)
Miscellaneous, including Shakespeare's account of the more spiritual

<p>To begin on the first division. There are many most interesting
passages which bristle with technical words; and these are liable to
be understood by the reader in a merely general way, with the result
that the point is wholly or partly missed. With a reasonable amount of
explanation, and a general caution to the student not to pass over
words or phrases that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> appear obscure, there is no reason why these
passages should not be understood by all in a much fuller light.</p>

similes that it may be useful to take them at once.</p>

<p>Here Lucrece tells the birds to cease their joyous notes, and calls on
the nightingale to sing the song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> of Tereus, while she herself bears
the 'burden' with her groans.</p>

<p>The first line contains a quibble on 'rests' and 'restless' discord.
'Nimble notes' was used in the Shakespearian time as we should use the
term 'brilliant music.' Lucrece was in no humour for trills and runs,
but rather for Dumps, where she could keep slow time with her tears.
The Dumpe (from Swedish Dialect, <i>dumpa</i>, to dance awkwardly) was a
slow, mournful dance. [See <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.] There is another quibble in l.
1131, on <i>strain</i>. A 'strain' is the proper Elizabethan word for a
formal phrase of a musical composition. For instance, in a Pavan,
Morley (Introduction to Practical Music, 1597) says a 'straine' should
consist of 8, 12, or 16 semibreves (we should say 'bars' instead of
'semibreves') 'as they list, yet fewer then eight I have not seene in
any pauan.'</p>

<p>'Diapason' meant the interval of an octave. Here Lucrece says she will
'bear the diapason' with deep groans, <i>i.e.</i>, 'hum' a 'burden' or
drone an octave lower than the nightingale's 'descant.' The earliest
'burden' known is that in the ancient Round 'Sumer is icumen in,' of
the 13th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> century. Here four voices sing the real music in canon to
these words&#8212;</p>

<p>while all the time two other voices of lower pitch sing a monotonous
refrain, 'Sing cuccu nu, Sing cuccu,' which they repeat <i>ad infinitum</i>
till the four who sing the Round are tired. This refrain is called Pes
(or 'foot'), and this is the kind of thing which Lucrece means by
'burden.' The word 'hum' may be considered technical, see the
<a href="#INTRODUCTORY">Introduction</a>, where '<i>buzzing</i> bass' is referred to. The tune, 'Light
o' love' [see <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>], as we know from <i>Much Ado</i> III, iv, 41, used
to go <i>without</i> a burden, and was considered a 'light' tune on that
account, see <i>Two Gent.</i> I, ii, 80.</p>

<p>'Descant,' in l. 1134, wants explaining. To 'descant' meant to sing or
play an <i>extempore</i> second 'part' to a written melody. The point was
that it should be extempore; if written down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> it ceased to be true
descant, and was then called 'prick-song.' A rough example may be had
in the extempore bass or alto which some people still sing in church
instead of the melody. A more accurate example of descant would be
this&#8212;let A sing a hymn tune, say the Old 100th, and let B accompany
him <i>extempore</i> with a separate melody within the bounds of harmony. B
is 'descanting' on the melody that A sings.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The art of descant in Elizabeth's time corresponded closely with what
we call 'Strict Counterpoint' (<i>contra</i>, <i>punctus</i>, hence
'prick-song,' or 'written' descant).</p>

<p>The modern equivalent for 'bear a part' (l. 1135) is 'sing a part.'
[See also Sonnet VIII.] Any person of decent education could 'bear a
part' in those days, <i>i.e.</i>, read at sight the treble, alto, tenor, or
bass 'part' of the work presented by the host for the diversion of his
guests. [See <a href="#INTRODUCTORY">Introduction</a>.]</p>

<p>L. 1140. 'Frets upon an instrument' can still be seen on the modern
mandoline, guitar, and banjo. In Shakespeare days, the viol, lute, and
cittern all had frets on the fingerboard, but they were then simply
bits of string tied round at the right places for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> the fingers, and
made fast with glue. Their use is referred to in the next line, to
'tune' the strings, <i>i.e.</i>, to 'stop' the string accurately at each
semitone.</p>

<p>There is a quaint illustration of ll. 1135-6, about the nightingale
singing 'against a thorn' to keep her awake, in the words of a
favourite old part song of King Henry VIII., 'By a bank as I lay,'
where the poem has these lines on the nightingale&#8212;</p>

<p>Perhaps it is sufficient to remark that many of the italicized words
above are still in ordinary use by musicians&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, to 'give the
note' in order to 'set' the pitch for singing; to 'keep in tune,' to
'sing out'; or one voice is 'drowned' by another, as the 'mean' (alto)
by the 'bass.' Once more we have quibbles on musical terms&#8212;Lucetta
says the 'tune,' <i>i.e.</i>, Julia's testiness about Proteus' letter, is
'too sharp,' and that her chiding of herself is 'too flat,' meaning,
that neither is in 'concord' with the spirit of the love-letter.
Lucetta recommends the middle course, or 'mean' (alto voice, midway
between treble and bass), 'to <i>fill</i> the song,' <i>i.e.</i>, to perfect the
harmony. Finally, there is a punning reference (somewhat prophetic) by
Lucetta, to the 'base' conduct of Proteus, in forsaking Julia for
Silvia. Another play upon words should not be missed, viz., in ll. 78
and 79, where 'set' does double duty.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>This</i> doth not so, for she <i>divideth us</i>.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Juliet evidently agrees with Portia that 'nothing is good without
respect.' The lark heralds the dawn, so Romeo must leave her, <i>ergo</i>,
the lark sings 'out of tune,' his strains are full of 'discords' and
'sharps.' The last two lines contain an interesting allusion in the
word 'division,' besides the pun on 'she <i>divideth us</i>.'</p>

<p>'Division' means roughly, a brilliant passage, of short notes, which
is founded essentially on a much simpler passage of longer notes. A
cant term for the old-fashioned variation (<i>e.g.</i>, the variations of
the 'Harmonious Blacksmith') was 'Note-splitting,' which at once
explains itself, and the older word 'Division.' A very clear example
of Divisions may be found in 'Rejoice greatly' in the Messiah. The
long 'runs' on the second syllable of '<i>Rejoice</i>,' consisting of
several groups of four semiquavers, are simply 'division' or
'note-splittings' of the first note of each group.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>The word, however, has a further use, namely, to play 'divisions' on a
viol-da-gamba. This was a favourite accomplishment of gentlemen in the
16th and 17th centuries. Sir Andrew Aguecheek numbered this amongst
his attainments, (see <i>Twelfth Night</i> I, iii, 24); and readers of John
Inglesant will remember that 'Mr Inglesant, being pressed to oblige
the company, played a descant upon a ground bass in the Italian
manner.' Playing a descant on a ground bass meant playing extempore
'divisions' or variations, to the harmony of a 'ground bass' which
(with its proper chords) was repeated again and again by the
harpsichordist, until the viol player had exhausted his capacity to
produce further 'breakings' of the harmony.</p>

<p>In 1665 there was published an instruction book in this art, called
Chelys Minuritionum, <i>i.e.</i>, the 'Tortoise-shell of Diminutions,'
hence (Chelys meaning a lyre, made of a tortoise-shell) 'The Division
Viol.' The book is by Christopher Sympson, a Royalist soldier, who was
a well-known viol-da-gamba player. The work is in three parts, the
third of which is devoted to the method of ordering division on a
ground.</p>

<p>To give his own words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>&#8212;</p>

<p>'Diminution or division to a ground, is the breaking either of the
bass or of any higher part that is applicable thereto. The manner of
expressing it is thus:&#8212;</p>

<p>'A ground, subject, or bass, call it what you please, is prick'd down
in two several papers; one for him who is to play the ground upon an
organ, harpsichord, or what other instrument may be apt for that
purpose; the other for him that plays upon the viol, who having the
said ground before his eyes as his theme or subject, plays such
variety of descant or division in concordance thereto as his skill and
present invention do then suggest unto him.'</p>

<p>[See the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a> for an example by Sympson.]</p>

<p>Further on, he distinguishes between 'breaking the notes of the
<i>ground</i>' and 'descanting upon' the ground.</p>

<p>This phrase, 'breaking' notes, may be taken as a partial explanation
of several passages on Shakespeare, where 'broken music' is referred
to, although it is likely that a better account of this may be found
in the natural imperfection of the Lute, which, being a <i>pizzicato</i>
instrument (<i>i.e.</i>, the strings were plucked, not played with a bow),
could not do more than indicate the harmony in 'broken' pieces, first
a bass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> note, then perhaps two notes at once, higher up in the scale,
the player relying on the hearer to piece the harmony together.</p>

<p>An entirely different explanation is that of Mr Chappell (in Aldis
Wright's Clarendon Press Edition of Henry V.), viz., that when a
'consort' of viols was imperfect, <i>i.e.</i>, if one of the players was
absent, and an instrument of another kind, <i>e.g.</i>, a flute, was
substituted, the music was thus said to be 'broken.' <i>Cf.</i> Matt.
Locke's 'Compositions for Broken and Whole Consorts,' 1672.</p>

<p>[Mr Aldis Wright has given me references to Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum,
III., 278, and Essay of Masque and Triumph, which show that 'Broken
Music' was understood to mean <i>any combination of instruments of
different kinds</i>. In Sylva Sylvarum Bacon mentions several 'consorts
of Instruments' which agree well together, <i>e.g.</i>, 'the Irish Harp and
Base-Viol agree well: the Recorder and Stringed Music agree well:
Organs and the Voice agree well, etc. But the Virginals and the Lute
... agree not so well.' All these, and similar combinations, seem to
have been described as 'Broken Music.']</p>

<p>In point, see <i>Hen. V.</i> V, ii, 248, where Henry proposes to
Katherine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>K. Hen.</i> Come, your answer in <i>broken music</i>; for thy
<i>voice is music</i>, and thy <i>English broken</i>; therefore, queen
of all, Katherine, <i>break</i> thy mind to me in <i>broken</i>
English: wilt thou have me?</p></div>

<p>Also see <i>Troilus</i> III, i, 52 and ff. (quoted further on).</p>

<p>An entirely separate use of 'break' is in the phrase 'broken time,'
which has the simple and obvious meaning that the notes do not receive
their due length and proportion. In this connection we will take the
passage of King Richard's speech in prison at Pontefract&#8212;when he
hears music without, performed by some friendly hands.</p>

<p><i>Rich. II.</i> V, v, 41. King R. in prison.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ha, ha! <i>keep time</i>.&#8212;How sour sweet music is,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When <i>time is broke</i>, and no <i>proportion kept</i>!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So is it in the music of men's lives.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But, for the <i>concord</i> of <i>my</i> state and <i>time</i>,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In me, it seems, it will make wise men mad.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>The simile is perfect, and the play upon 'time broke' admirable. In l.
45 Richard reflects on the sad contrast between his quick 'ear' for
'broken time' in music, and his slowness to hear the 'breaking' of his
<i>own</i> 'state and time.' The 'disorder'd string' is himself, who has
been playing his part 'out of time' ('Disorder'd' simply means 'out of
its place'&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, as we now say, 'a bar wrong'), and this has
resulted in breaking the 'concord'&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, the harmony of the various
parts which compose the state.</p>

<p>A few words are necessary about 'Proportion.' This term was used in
Elizabethan times exactly as we now use 'Time.' The 'times' used in
modern music can practically be reduced to two&#8212;viz., Duple (two beats
to the bar) and Triple (three beats to the bar). But in Elizabeth's
day the table of various Proportions was a terribly elaborate thing.
Of course many of these 'Proportions' never really came into practical
use&#8212;but there was plenty of mystery left even after all deductions.</p>

<p>Morley (Introduction, 1597) gives Five kinds of proportions 'in most
common use'&#8212;viz., Dupla, Tripla, Quadrupla, Sesquialtera, and
Sesquitertia. The first three correspond to what we still call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> Duple,
Triple, and Quadruple Time&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, 2 in the bar, 3 in the bar, and 4
in the bar. ['Bars' were not in general use till the end of the 16th
century, but the principle was the same. The bars themselves are
merely a convenience.]</p>

<p>Sesquialtera is more complicated, and means 'three notes are sung to
two of the same kinde'; and 'Sesquitertia is when four notes are sung
to three of the same kinde.' 'But' (Morley adds), 'if a man would
ingulphe himselfe to learn to sing, and set down all them which
Franchinus Gaufurius [1496] hath set down in his booke De
Proportionibus Musicis, he should find it a matter not only hard but
almost impossible.'</p>

<p>Ornithoparcus, in his Micrologus (1535), gives us an idea of the way
this subject of proportion was treated by more 'learned' writers. He
says (1) that music considers only the proportion of inequality, (2)
that this is two-fold&#8212;viz., the greater and the lesser inequality.
(3) The greater inequality contains five proportions, namely,
multiplex, superparticular, superpartiens, multiplex superparticular,
and multiplex superpartiens.</p>

<p>This is more amusing than instructive, perhaps. The three last lines
of this passage refer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> various stories of real or pretended
cure of disease by the use of particular pieces of music. One of the
best known of these diseases is 'Tarantism,' or the frenzy produced by
the bite of the Tarantula, in Italy.</p>

<p>Kircher, a learned Jesuit (1601-1680), gives an account, in his
&quot;Musurgia,&quot; of the cure of this madness by certain airs, by which the
patient is stimulated to dance violently. The perspiration thus
produced was said to effect a cure. In his &quot;Phonurgia nova&quot; (1673)
Kircher actually gives the notes of the tune by which one case was
cured.</p>

<p>In this connection, Kircher mentions King Saul's madness, which was
relieved by David's harp playing. This is certainly to the point, and
may well have been in Shakespeare's mind. [See George Herbert's poem,
'Doomsday,' verse 2.]</p>

<p>Our modern Tarantellas derive their name and characteristic speed from
the old Tarantula.</p>

<p><i>Lear</i> I, ii, 137. Edmund pretends not to see Edgar's entrance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Edmund (aside).</i> Pat he comes, like the catastrophe of the
old comedy: my cue is villainous melancholy, with a <i>sigh
like Tom o' Bedlam</i>.&#8212;O! these eclipses do portend <i>these
divisions</i>. <i>Fa, sol, la, mi.</i></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Songs like 'Tom o' Bedlam,' mad-songs they were called, were very
commonly sung in England in the 17th century. The tune and words of
the original 'Tom a Bedlam' are to be found in Chappell, Vol. I. p.
175. Its date is some time before 1626,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and verse 1 begins, 'From
the hagg and hungrie Goblin,' and the whole is as full of ejaculations
of 'Poor Tom' as Act III. of <i>Lear</i>.</p>

<p>The last sentence has yet another play on the double meaning of
'divisions.' A few lines further on Edmund explains what kind of
'divisions' he expects to follow the eclipses&#8212;namely, 'between the
child and the parent ... dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in
state,' etc. But the very use of the word in the quoted lines brings
its musical meaning into his head, for he promptly carries off his
assumed blindness to Edgar's presence by humming over his 'fa, sol,
la, mi.' [Burney, Hist., Vol. III. p. 344, has a sensible observation
on this passage&#8212;that Edgar alludes to the unnatural division of
parent and child, etc., in this musical phrase, which contains the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
augmented fourth, or <i>mi contra fa</i>, of which the old theorists used
to say 'diabolus est.']</p>

<p>Guido d'Arezzo (or Aretinus), in his Micrologus (about 1024), named
the six notes of the Hexachord (<i>e.g.</i>, C, D, E, F, G, A), thus&#8212;Ut,
Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La. These were the first syllables of certain words
in the Hymn for the feast of St John Baptist, the words and tune of
which are in Hawkins, p. 163.</p>

<p>A rough translation of which is&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'That thy servants may be able with free hearts to sound
forth the wonders of thy deeds; release us, O Holy John,
from the guilt of a defiled lip.'</p></div>

<p>In the ancient tune of this verse, the notes assigned to the syllables
in capitals were successively those of the scale, C, D, E, F, G, A,
and these same syllables were still used in singing in the 16th
century. It was noticed, however, that the scale could be easily
expressed by fewer names, and accordingly we find Christopher Sympson
(1667) saying, in his 'Compendium,' that Ut and Re are 'superfluous,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> therefore laid aside by most Modern Teachers.' In his book, the
whole scale of <i>eight</i> notes is named thus&#8212;Fa, Sol, La, Fa, Sol, La,
<i>mi</i>, Fa. A modern Tonic Solfaist would understand this arrangement
quite differently. C, D, E would be called Do (instead of Ut), Re, Mi;
then would follow F, G, A, under the names Fa, Sol, La; and the
'leading note' [top note but one] would be called Ti (instead of Si);
the octave C beginning once more with Do.</p>

<p>The reader will remember that the tonal relation of C, D, E is exactly
the same as that of the next three notes, F, G, A&#8212;viz., C&#8212;D, a tone;
D&#8212;E, a tone; and similarly with F&#8212;G, G&#8212;A. Therefore the two blocks
of three notes (which are separated by a <i>semi</i>-tone) might have the
same names&#8212;viz., Fa, sol, la. Thus we have the first <i>six</i> notes of
the scale, Fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la. There only remains one note, the
'leading note,' the B; and this, in Sympson, is named <i>Mi</i>. So the
principal thing in the sol-fa-ing of a passage was to 'place the Mi,'
or, as we should now put it, to find 'what key' it is in. Thus, in the
key of C, Mi is in B: in G, Mi is in F sharp: in F, Mi is in E, and so
on, the remaining six notes being named Fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, as
explained above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Edmund's 'Fa, Sol, La, Mi,' therefore, corresponds to F, G, A, B; or
C, D, E, F sharp; or B flat, C, D, E, etc.; according to the pitch
taken by the singer.</p>

<p>In this connection see the following passage:&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Shrew</i> I, ii, 16.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Petr.</i> 'Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll <i>wring</i> it:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'll try how you can <i>sol, fa</i>, and <i>sing it</i>.'</span>
</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 15em;">[He wrings <span class="smcap">Grumio</span> by the ears.</span>
</p></div>

<p>Here is a pun on 'wring' and 'ring'; and 'sol-fa' is used as an
equivalent for 'sing.'</p>

<p>More important still is 'the gamut of Hortensio,' <i>Shrew</i> III, i, 72.
[Gam-ut was the name of the Ut of lowest pitch, corresponding to the
low G on the first line of our present bass staff, and was marked
specially with a Greek Gamma, hence Gam-ut. The word became a synonym
for 'the Scale.']</p>

<p>In this passage the names of the notes are simply those to be found in
all instruction books of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>

<p>Here Hortensio puts in his love-verses under the guise of a
musicmaster's Gamut.</p>

<p>The lines may be taken separately as fantastic commentaries on the
syllables themselves, as well as having their ulterior meaning for
Bianca.</p>

<p>For instance, Gam-ut the <i>lowest</i> note then recognised in the scale,
is called 'the <i>ground</i> of all <i>accord</i>.' A-re, I suppose, represents
the lover's sigh 'to plead his passion.' B-mi, may be twisted into 'Be
mine,' by the light of the remaining words in the line; while 'D sol
re, one cliff, two notes have I' obviously refers to Hortensio's
disguise. The 'cliff' is what is now called a 'clef,' or 'key,'
because its position on the staff gave the 'key' to the position of
the semitones and tones on the various lines and spaces. The six notes
here mentioned are the G, A, B, C, D, E, in the bass staff. They could
only be written (as they are yet) in <i>one</i> clef&#8212;namely, the F clef.
The expression 'two notes have I,' as applied to the D, means that, in
the key of G, D is called Sol; while in the key of C it would have the
name Re; just as Hortensio is Hortensio, and at the same time
masquerades as a singing-master.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been mentioned that the art of adding an extempore counterpoint
to a written melody was called 'descant.' The written melody itself
was called the 'Plain-song,' and hence the whole performance,
plainsong and descant together, came to be known by the term
'Plain-song,' as opposed to the performance of plainsong with a
<i>written</i> descant; which was known as 'Prick-song.'</p>

<p>Morley gives us a clear idea that the extempore descant was often a
very unsatisfactory performance, at any rate when it was attempted to
add more than one extempore part at a time to the plainsong. As he
says&#8212;'For though they should all be moste excellent men ... it is
unpossible for them to be true one to another.' The following passage
will be more clear on this light.</p>

<p><i>H. 5.</i> III, ii, 3. Fight at Harfleur.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Nym.</i> Pray thee, corporal, stay: ... the humour of it is
too hot, that is the very <i>plain-song</i> of it.</p>

<p><i>Pistol.</i> <i>The plain-song is most just</i>, for humours do
abound.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>

<p>L. 41.</p>

<p><i>Boy</i> (speaks of the 3 rogues).... They will steal anything,
and call it purchase. Bardolph <i>stole a lute-case</i>, bore it
twelve leagues, and <i>sold it for three half-pence</i>.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Falstaff's worthy body-guard are getting tired of hard knocks in
fight; Nym compares their late activity to a somewhat florid
'plain-song' [meaning an extempore descant, as explained above];
Pistol says it is a 'just' plainsong. A 'just' plainsong would mean
that the singer had managed his extempore descant 'without singing
eyther false chords or forbidden descant one to another.' Similarly,
there is little doubt that both Ancient and Corporal managed to take a
part in the skirmishings with as little damage as possible to their
sconces.</p>

<p>The speech of the boy at l. 41 hardly enrols Bardolph amongst music
lovers. At all events he stole a lute-case, and seems to have liked it
so much that he carried it 36 miles before his worser nature prevailed
on him to sell it for 1-1/2d.</p>

<p>The next quotation still concerns Jack Falstaff and his crew, all of
whom (and strictly in accordance with history) seem to have been sound
practical musicians. This time they are speaking, not of descant, but
of Prick-song. The chiefest virtue in the performance of Prick-song,
by which Falstaff and Nym probably understood both sacred and secular
part-music, is that a man should 'keep time,' religiously counting his
rests, 'one, two, three, and the third in your bosom,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> and when he
begins to sing, that he should 'keep time, distance, and proportion,'
as Mercutio says Tybalt did in his fencing, see <i>Romeo</i> II, iv, 20.</p>

<p>All this is thoroughly appreciated by Falstaff and his corporal in the
following lines:&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Merry Wiv.</i> I, iii, 25.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Falstaff</i> (of Bardolph) ... his thefts were too open; his
filching was <i>like an unskilful singer</i>, he <i>kept not time</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nym.</i> The good humour is to <i>steal at a minim's rest</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">['Minims' is a modern conjecture.]</p></div>

<p>The metaphor is of an anthem or madrigal, say in four parts. We will
suppose the Hostess of the 'Garter' is taking the <i>Cantus</i>, a tapster
the <i>Altus</i>, mine Host the <i>Tenor</i>, and Nym the <i>Bassus</i>. The three
former are all hard at work on their respective 'parts,' one in the
kitchen, another in the taproom, the third in familiar converse
outside the front door. But Nym has 'a minim rest,' and during that
short respite takes advantage of the absorbing occupations of the
other three 'singers' to lay hands on whatever portable property is
within his reach. 'A minim rest' is not much&#8212;but the point remains.
Any musician has had experience of what can be done during a short
'rest'&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, to resin his bow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> or turn up the corners of the next
few pages of his music, light the gas, or find his place in another
book.</p>

<p>By an easy transition we pass to the following:&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Pericles</i> I, i, 81. Pericles addresses the daughter of King

<p>Pericles compares the lawful love of a wife with the performance of a
good viol player, the proper characteristics of which would be, 'in
tune,' and 'in time.' The comparison in l. 84 is of this girl's
lawless passion with the 'disorder'd' playing of a bad violist, who
has got 'out,' as we say; who is playing 'before his time,' thus
entirely spoiling the music, which becomes a dance for devils rather
than angels.</p>

<p>The viol was decidedly the most important stringed instrument played
with a bow that was in use in Elizabethan times. There were three
different sizes.</p>

<p>The reader will get a sufficiently accurate idea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> both of the sizes
and the use of viols, if he will consider the treble viol to have
corresponded closely with our modern violin, the tenor viol to the
modern viola [which is also called Alto, Tenor, or Bratsche&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>,
braccio, 'arm' fiddle], and the bass-viol, or viol-da-gamba [so called
because held between the knees], to the modern violoncello.</p>

<p>The principal difference from our modern stringed instruments was that
all the viols had <i>six</i> strings, whereas now there is no 'fiddle' of
any sort with more than four. A secondary difference was, that all the
viol family had <i>frets</i> on the fingerboard to mark out the notes,
whereas the finger-boards of all our modern instruments are smooth,
and the finger of the performer has to do without any help of that
kind.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>John Playford, in 1683, published his 'Introduction to the Skill of
Music,' which gives an account of the viols, and Thomas Mace, of
Cambridge, lay clerk of Trinity, in his 'Musick's Monument,' pub.
1676, gives full instructions how many viols and other instruments of
this kind are necessary. From these we learn that viols were always
kept in sets of six&#8212;two trebles, two tenors, and two basses&#8212;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
set was technically known as a 'Chest' of viols. Mace also says that
the treble viol had its strings just half the length of the bass viol,
and the tenor was of a medium size between these. Also he says that if
you add to these a couple of violins (which were then thought somewhat
vulgar, loud instruments) for jovial occasions, and a pair of 'lusty,
full-sized Theorboes,'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> 'you have a ready entertainment for the
greatest prince in the world.'</p>

<p>The tuning of the six strings on the <i>bass</i>-viol was, on the bass
staff, 1st string, or treble, D over the staff; 2nd or small mean, A
on the top line; 3rd or great mean, E in the third space; 4th or
counter-tenor, C in the second space; 5th or tenor, or gamut, G on the
first line; and the 6th or bass, low D, under the staff. On the most
complete viol there would be seven frets, arranged semitonally, so the
compass of the Bass Viol or Viol da Gamba would be about two octaves
and a half, from D under the bass staff to A on the second space of
the treble staff. [In South Kensington Museum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> is a Viol da Gamba with
no less than twelve frets still remaining. This would make the compass
nearly <i>three</i> octaves.]</p>

<p>The tenor-viol had its top string tuned to G on the second line of the
treble staff; and the remaining five were the same in pitch as the top
five on the bass viol. The treble viol (as mentioned above) was tuned
exactly an octave above the bass.</p>

<p>The tone of the viols is very much like that of our modern bowed
instruments, the principal difference being that they are a little
feebler, and naturally more calm. The reason is that vigorous 'bowing'
is a risky thing on the viol, for, as there are <i>six</i> strings on the
arc of the bridge, more care is required to avoid striking two or even
three at once than on the violin, which has only four.</p>

<p>The amateur of music would keep a 'Chest' of six Viols in his house,
and when his musical friends visited him, they would generally play
'Fancies' (or Fantasias) see <i>H. 4. B.</i> III, ii, 323, in several
parts, from two to the full six, according to the number of those
present. Amongst a great number of composers of this kind of music,
some very well known names are, John Jenkins, Chris. Sympson, William
Lawes, Coperario (John Cooper), and the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> Monteverde. It was
common for the Organ or other keyed instrument to join with the viols
in these pieces, and thus fill out the chords of the 'consort,' as it
was called.</p>

<p>We still have one of the viol tribe left in our orchestra. The
double-bass (or viol-one) is lineal descendant of the Chest of viols.
Its shape, especially at the shoulders, is quite characteristic, and
elsewhere&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, the blunt curves of the waist, the outline of the
back, and even the shape of the bow.</p>

<p>The practice of playing extempore variations on the viol da gamba has
already been mentioned as one of the elegant accomplishments of a
gentleman in those days. The following two quotations therefore will
not require further remark.</p>

</p></div>

<p>The <i>violin</i> family had only a precarious footing amongst musicians up
to 1650. After that time, the viols declined in favour, and so
rapidly, that at the very beginning of the 18th century, Dr Tudway of
Cambridge describes a chest of viols, in a letter to his son, with
such particularity, that it is clear they had entirely fallen out of
use by 1700. As the viol fell out of fashion, the violin took its
place, and has kept it ever since.</p>

<p>The violin family had come into general and fashionable use under the
patronage of the Court of Louis XIV., and thus the English nation,
true to their ancient habit of buying their 'doublet in Italy, round
hose in France, bonnet in Germany, and behaviour everywhere,' took up
the 'French fiddles,' and let their national Chest of viols go to the
wall.</p>

<p>This growing tendency to adopt French customs, even in music, is
referred to in the following:&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Hen. VIII.</i> I, iii, 41. French manners in England.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Lovell.</i> A <i>French song</i>, and a <i>fiddle</i>, has no fellow.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And have an hour of hearing: and, by'r lady,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Held <i>current music</i> too.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The only word here that has not already been fully explained is
'current music,' which I suppose to mean simply, that the old
accomplishments of which Lord Sands speaks would be still thought 'up
to date' and in the fashion.</p>

<p>Another instrument in common domestic use was the Recorder. This was a
kind of 'Beak-flute,' like a flageolet. Lord Bacon says it had a
conical bore, and six holes. So it had the general figure of a modern
Oboe, but was played with a 'whistle' mouthpiece instead of a reed.</p>

<p>The six holes may still be seen on any penny whistle, or the brass
flageolets in the music-shops.</p>

<p>The Recorder was known for its sweet tone. Poets used the word
'record' to signify the song of birds, especially of the nightingale.</p>

<p>Hawkins identifies it with the Fistula Dulcis, seu Anglica, and gives
two pictures which help to explain the next quotation.</p>

<p>In South Kensington Museum there is a Recorder<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> made of a dark
wood, which is nothing else but a big flageolet. Its length is 2 ft. 2
in., and its bore is that of the modern flageolet and old flute&#8212;viz.,
conical, but with the wide end nearest the player's mouth.</p>

<p><i>Hamlet</i> III, ii, 346. Enter Players with recorders.</p>

<i>easier to be played on than a pipe</i>? Call me what

<i>play</i> upon me.</p></div>

<p>The holes in a flute have always been called 'ventages,' because the
'wind' comes through them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> when the fingers are removed. They were
'governed' 'with the finger and thumb.' One of the illustrations from
Mersennus [b. 1588] shows a conical flute with four holes in front and
two at the back. These latter would, of course, be controlled by the
<i>thumbs</i>, while the others would occupy two fingers on each hand.
(Modern flageolets still keep a thumb hole at the back.) There were
other beaked flutes of the same period, of a better class, which had
several keys as well as the holes.</p>

<p>'The stops' referred to by Hamlet are merely the 'ventages.' The act
of covering a hole with the finger or thumb was called 'stopping'; and
further, one example of the Fistula Dulcis given by Mersennus has two
different holes for the lowest note, one on the right and the other on
the left, so that the instrument might be used either by a
right-handed or left-handed person. One of these two duplicate holes
was temporarily <i>stopped</i> with wax. [The passing play upon 'fret' in
the last line should not be missed.]</p>

<p>In the next passage the meaning of stop as applied to Recorders is
punned on by Hippolyta, who carries on the play from Lysander's
horsebreaking metaphor.</p>

<p><i>Mids.</i> V, i, 108. The Prologue speaks with all the punctuation
wrong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

knows not the <i>stop</i>....</p>

<p><i>Hippolyta.</i> Indeed, he hath played on this prologue like a
<i>child on a recorder, a sound</i>, but <i>not in government</i>.</p></div>

<p>That is&#8212;the Prologue has misplaced all his <i>stops</i>&#8212;like a young
horse that refuses to <i>stop</i>&#8212;also like a child who has not learned to
<i>stop</i> the holes on the flute <i>&#224; bec</i>.</p>

<p>It is singular that the Virginal, which was the most popular of all
the keyed instruments, is nowhere directly named in Shakespeare. There
is, however, a reference to the action of the fingers on its keys in
the following.</p>

<p><i>Winter's Tale</i> I, ii, 125. Of <i>Hermione</i>, Queen of Leontes, King of
Sicilia, and <i>Polixenes</i>, King of Bohemia.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Leon.</i> &#8212;&#8212; still <i>virginalling</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Upon his palm?</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The Virginal (generally known as 'a <i>pair</i> of virginals') was most
commonly used by ladies for their private recreation, and from this
circumstance is supposed to derive its name. Queen Elizabeth was fond
of playing on it, but as it was in vogue before her time, there is no
need to connect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> name with the Virgin Queen. (Elizabeth's own
Virginal is in South Kensington Museum.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>) Its keyboard has four
octaves, and the case is square, like that of a very old pianoforte.
The strings of the virginal were plucked, by quills,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which were
secured to the 'jacks' [see Sonnet cxxviii.], which in turn were set
in motion by the keys. The strings were wire. The oldest country dance
known, the Sellenger's (St Leger's) Round, of Henry VIII.'s time, was
arranged by Byrd as a Virginal 'lesson' for 'Lady Nevell's booke.'
Another well-known Virginal Book, that at the Fitzwilliam Museum at
Cambridge, commonly known as 'Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book,' is
being published by Breitkopf &amp; H&#228;rtel.</p>

<p>The first music ever printed for the Virginals was 'Parthenia,'
published in London, 1611. This collection contains principally Pavans
and Galliards by Byrd, Bull, and Gibbons. The title 'Parthenia, or the
Maydenhead of the firste musicke,' etc., with a picture of a young
lady playing on the virginal, seems to confirm our explanation of the
name of this instrument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to the viol, the lute<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> was the most popular stringed
instrument. It was used both as a Solo instrument on which to play
sprightly 'Ayres,' or as an accompaniment for the voice, or 'in
consort' with other instruments. Naturally, it figured frequently in
'serenading' especially when a love song had to be sung outside a
lady's window. The general shape of a Lute was that of a mandoline,
but about four times as big. Like the mandoline, it had a flat belly,
and a great basin-shaped back. But in every other respect it was
entirely different. It was used more in the fashion of a guitar, and
its strings (which were of gut) were plucked with the fingers.</p>

<p>Adrian Le Roy's book, published in Paris about 1570, says the six
strings were tuned as follows&#8212;1st (minikin), C in third space, treble
staff; 2nd (small mean), G on second line; 3rd (great mean), D under
the staff; 4th (counter-tenor), B flat over the bass staff; 5th
(tenor), F on fourth line; and 6th (base), C in second space.</p>

<p>Scipione Cerreto, however (Naples 1601), gives quite a different
account of the Italian Lute of eight strings, the tuning of which
seems to have extended the compass downwards to C under the bass
staff. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> Mace (Musicks Monument, 1676) tells of several
objections against the lute, the most noteworthy of which were&#8212;1st,
that it was a costly instrument to keep in repair; 2nd, that it was
out of fashion; and 3rd, that it <i>made young people grow awry</i>. Mace
refutes these calumnies, the last of which no doubt was set about on
account of the very awkward shape of the lute back, and the
considerable size of the instrument. Hawkins (Hist. of Music, pp. 730
and 731) gives two pieces for the lute by Mace, or, rather, the same
piece twice, first for one lute, then arranged for two. [<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.]</p>

<p>The five lower strings of the lute were 'doubled'&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, there were
two of each pitch, duplicates, which helped the tone of the chords by
'sympathetic' vibration. So there were really eleven strings, but only
six different pitches. There were eight frets on the fingerboard.</p>

<p>Other varieties were the Arch-Lute<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and the Theorbo-Lute, both of
which had very long double necks, and a large number of strings. One
Archlute in South Kensington Museum has as many as 24, eleven of which
are duplications.</p>

<p>The first of these three passages will be quite clear to the reader in
the light of the remarks on the lute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> already made. The second should
be read in connection with the name of the doleful dance above
mentioned, the Dump. [See <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.]</p>

<p>The third quotation contains interesting allusions to the
peculiarities of the lute. Lines 22-25 are very naturally accounted
for. The lute, having at least eleven strings, took a long time to get
into tune. Even our modern violins, with only four strings, want
constant attention in this respect; and the lute, therefore,
especially in the hands of an amateur, might well get a name for being
a troublesome instrument. The reference to the 'treble' and 'bass'
strings (<i>i.e.</i>, the 1st and 6th) has been explained before. 'Spit in
the hole, man,' Lucentio's very rude advice to Hortensio, will direct
our attention to the variously shaped 'holes' which were made in the
belly of all stringed instruments to let out the sound. On the lute,
this hole was commonly a circular opening, not clearly cut out, but
fretted in a circle of small holes with a star in the middle. But this
was not the only way. A lute in South Kensington Museum has <i>three</i>
round holes, placed in an oblique line, nearly at the bottom of the
instrument.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The holes on the viol were generally in the form of
crescents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> and were put one on each side of the bridge. On the modern
violins, as everybody has seen, they are in the shape of
<img src="images/violin.jpg" width="36" height="26" alt="f holes" title="f holes" />, and are known as '<i>f</i>' holes.</p>

<p>Line 59, about 'lessons in three parts,' is of interest. Primarily, it
is another form of 'Two's company, three is none'&#8212;but its musical
meaning is very plainly present. In the 16th and 17th centuries it was
very common to call the pieces of music in any volume for an
instrument by the name 'Lessons.' The first meaning, of course, was
that they were examples for the pupil in music, but the word was used
quite freely with the purely general signification of 'Pieces' or
'Movements.'</p>

<p>One more word deserves remark&#8212;viz., 'to touch,' in line 63. This is
used technically, and means strictly 'to play' on the instrument. The
word comes both in meaning and form from Ital., <i>toccare</i>.</p>

<p><i>Toccata</i> was a common word for a Prelude (often extempore), intended
as a kind of introduction to two or three more formal movements. The
Italian for a peal of bells is <i>tocco di campana</i>, and we have the
word in English under the form <i>tocsin</i>, an alarm bell. The
trumpet-call known as 'Tucket,' which occurs seven times in the stage
directions of six Shakespeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> plays, and is also found once in the
text (<i>Henry V.</i> IV, ii, 35), also is derived from <i>toccare</i>.
Similarly with the German 'Tusch,' a flourish of trumpets and other
brass instruments, which may be heard under that name to the present
day.</p>

<p>The next passage confirms Morley's account of the high estimation in
which music was held as a part of a liberal education. Baptista
evidently considers 'good bringing up' to include 'music, instruments,
and poetry.' Moreover, the visiting master was to be well paid,&#8212;'to
cunning men I will be very kind.'</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Songs and Singing</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible here to give even an outline of the history of Songs
and Singing in England. The general statement must suffice that vocal
music, accompanied by viols and harps, with songs and catches, were
common in the year 1230 in France; and any reader of Chaucer and Gower
may see for himself that vocal music was flourishing in the 14th
century in England. The English Round or Catch, mentioned above,
'Sumer is icumen in,' is most probably of the 13th century, and that
alone would be sufficient to characterise the popular vocal music of
that day. This composition is advanced in every way, being very
melodious, and at the same time showing that vocal harmony (<i>i.e.</i>,
singing in parts) was greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>To proceed to a time nearer the age with which we are concerned&#8212;in
Henry VII.'s reign, there were many songs written, some for voices
only, and some with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> instrumental accompaniment. Amongst the former
are two songs in three parts, the music by William Cornyshe, Junior,
which are given in Hawkins.</p>

<p>Skelton wrote the words of the first, 'Ah, beshrew you by my fay,'
which is very coarse in tone, as was frequently the case with him; and
the second one, 'Hoyday, jolly ruttekin,' is a satire on the drunken
habits of the Flemings who came over with Anne of Cleves. Mrs Page
(<i>Wiv.</i> II, i, 23) refers to these Dutchmen, where, after receiving
Falstaff's love-letter, she exclaims, 'what an unweighed behaviour
hath this <i>Flemish Drunkard</i> picked (with the devil's name!) out of my
conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?'</p>

<p>The following is a curious picture by 'Skelton, Laureate,' of an
ignorant singer, who appears to have been throwing mud at the poet.
Skelton gives us a sad account both of his morals and his music.</p>

<p>The 3rd verse begins&#8212;</p>

<p>Skelton's main objection to this person is that he, being in reality
of very humble origin, presumed on his very doubtful musical abilities
to gain a foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>ing amongst his betters. As he says, 'For Jak wold be a
Jentilman that late was a grome.'</p>

<p>Evidently 'Jak' had managed to make good his position as a fashionable
teacher of singing, in spite of the defects plainly mentioned in the
above verses. In the first verse, 'counter' is a musical term, here
used with the meaning of 'to embroider' the tale. 'Knack' is still
used in Yorkshire for 'affected talk.' 'Monachord' is the ancient
one-stringed fiddle called Tromba Marina, and is here used as a joke
on 'monachi' or 'holy water clarks.' In verse 2, '<i>rule</i> and space' is
simply 'line and space,' <i>i.e.</i>, on the musical staff. 'Solfyth too
haute' is 'Solfa's too high.' The 'my' which was 'too sharp' is the
Mi, the seventh note of the scale, mentioned above as the critical
point in Solfa. In verse 3, 'lewde lewte' means merely 'vulgar lute';
and 'Rotybulle Joyse' is the title of an old song. The 'payre of
clavicordys' is the clavichord, which in 1536 was a keyed instrument
of much the same kind as the virginals,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> with about three and a
half octaves. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> was used by nuns, and therefore had its strings
muffled with bits of cloth to deaden the sound.</p>

<p>The last three lines quoted mention 'solfa' and 'fayne.' The latter is
'feigned' music, or Musica Ficta, which at this time was the art of
dislocating the 'Mi,' so as to change the key. It was seldom that more
than one flat was found in those days, and this would move the Mi from
<i>B</i> to <i>E</i>, thus constituting 'fayned' music.</p>

<p>This account will give a general idea of the kind of songs and singing
that were to be found in 1500.</p>

<p>Popular songs, 'Rotybulle Joyse,' with a burden of 'Rumbill downe,
tumbill downe,' etc., accompanied by a 'lewde lewte'; clavichord
playing; solfaing; singing of both 'prick-' and 'plain-' song, with
Musica Ficta; besides the delectable art of 'whysteling'; seem to have
been matters in ordinary practice at the beginning of the 16th
century. Add to these the songs in three parts, with rounds or catches
for several voices, and we have no mean list of musicianly
accomplishments, which the men of Shakespeare's day might inherit.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare, besides the songs most commonly known (some of which
are by earlier authors), there are allusions to many kinds of vocal
music, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> scraps of the actual words of old songs&#8212;some with
accompaniment, some without; a duet; a trio; a chorus; not to mention
several rounds, either quoted or alluded to.</p>

<p>It will be useful here to refer to a few of these less known examples.</p>

<p><i>L.L.L.</i> I, ii, 106. The Ballad of 'The King and the Beggar.' Moth
says &quot;The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages
since; but I think now 'tis not to be found; or, if it were, it would
neither serve for the writing, nor the tune.&quot;</p>

says of the lark's song, 'that voice doth us affray, Hunting thee
hence with <i>hunts-up</i> to the day.' Any rousing morning song, even a
love-song, was called a <i>hunts-up</i>. The tune of this song was also
sung (in 1584) to 'O sweete Olyver, leave me not behind the,' but
altering the time to 4 in a bar. See <i>As You Like It</i> III, iii, 95.</p>

<p>Also see <i>Wiv.</i> V, v, 20. The tune is given in its most complete form

<p>The 'Hundredth Psalm' (All people that on earth do dwell) will only
adhere and keep place with the tune of Green Sleeves to a certain
extent. If the reader will try to sing it to the tune in the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>,
he will find that in the first half he is led into several false
accents; while the second half is quite unmanageable without altering
the notes. There is, however, a form of the tune in Hawkins which is
much further off 'the truth of the words,' for it has exactly the
right quantity of <i>notes</i>, but the <i>accents</i> are all as wrong as
possible, thus&#8212;</p>

<p><i>H. 4. B.</i> III, ii, 320. Falstaff soliloquises on Shallow's lies
concerning his wild youth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Fal.</i> He (Shallow) came ever in the rearward of the
fashion, and <i>sung those tunes</i> ... that he heard the
<i>carmen whistle</i>, and sware&#8212;they were his <i>fancies</i>, or his
<i>goodnights</i>.... The <i>case of a treble hautboy</i> was a
mansion for him, a court.</p></div>

<p>The Carman's Whistle was a popular Elizabethan tune, and was arranged
as a virginal lesson by Byrd. This arrangement can be had most readily
in Litolff's publication, 'Les ma&#238;tres du Clavecin.'</p>

<p>The 'fancies' referred to above are the 'Fantazies' already remarked
on (chest of viols); and the 'Goodnights' are songs <i>in memoriam</i>, or
dirges.</p>

<p>'Fortune my foe.' [<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>]. <i>Merry Wives</i> III, iii, 62. <i>Falstaff</i>
(to Mrs Ford). 'I see what thou wert, if <i>Fortune thy foe</i> were not,
Nature thy friend.' This old tune is at latest of Elizabeth's time,
and was sung to the ancient ballad of &quot;Titus Andronicus.&quot; The first
verse of 'Fortune my foe' is as follows:&#8212;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
&quot;Fortune my foe, why dost thou frown on me?<br />
And will thy favour never better be?<br />

<p>'Ophelia's Songs.' <i>Hamlet</i> IV, v. [<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>]. 'How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> should I your
true love know'; 'Good morrow, 'tis St Valentine's day'; 'They bore
him barefaste'; 'Bonny sweet Robin'; 'And will he not come again.'</p>

<p>The one line of 'Bonny sweet Robin' is all that remains of the song,
except the title, which is also the first line&#8212;viz., 'My Robin is to
the greenwood gone.' The line Shakespeare gives would be the last. One
tune to it is at any rate older than 1597.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are the old catches, 'Hold thy peace,' sung by Toby, Sir
Andrew, and Feste in <i>Twelfth Night</i> II, iii; 'Jack boy, ho boy, news,
The cat is in the well,' etc., referred to by Grumio in <i>Shrew</i> IV, i,
42; besides 'Flout 'em and scout em,' sung by Stephano, Trinculo, and
Caliban in <i>Tempest</i> III, ii; and 'What shall he have that killed the
deer,' for the foresters in <i>As You Like It</i> IV, ii, 5. The original
music of the first two, probably much earlier than Shakespeare, is in
the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>. A Round for four voices by John Hilton (flourished 1600)
to 'What shall he have,' is probably the first setting, and may be
seen in Rimbault, p. 19. Purcell (1675) set 'Flout 'em' as a catch for
three voices, which is in Caulfield's Collection of Shakespeare Vocal
Music, 1864. These last two are poor specimens of Catches, so they are
not printed here. [The proper reading of 'Flout 'em,' in the 4tos and
1st Fol. is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> 'Flout 'em and <i>cout</i> 'em! and <i>skowt</i> 'em, and flout
'em! Thought is free.']</p>

<p>The following passage contains a large quantity of the history of
songs in the 16th century, and is one of the most important to be
found in Shakespeare. Autolycus sells ballads 'of all sizes' among his
wares; the country folk, Mopsa, Dorcas, and the Clown, buy them, and
afterwards sing them; and the rustic servant distinctly prefers the
pedlar's vocalisation to their accustomed 'tabor and pipe,' or even to
the 'bagpipe.'</p>

<p><i>Winter's Tale</i> IV, iii, 181.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Servant.</i> O master! if you did but hear the <i>pedlar</i> at the
door, you would <i>never dance again after a tabor and pipe</i>;
no, the <i>bagpipe</i> could not move you. He <i>sings several
tunes</i> faster than you'll tell money; he utters them as he
had <i>eaten ballads</i>, and all men's ears grew to his tunes.</p>

<p><i>Clown.</i> He could never come better: he shall come in. <i>I
love a ballad</i> but even too well; if it be doleful matter,
merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing indeed, and sung
lamentably.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> He hath <i>songs</i>, for man or woman, <i>of all
sizes</i>.... He has the prettiest <i>love-songs</i> for maids; so
without bawdry, which is strange; with such <i>delicate
burdens</i> of &quot;dildos&quot; and &quot;fadings,&quot; &quot;jump her and thump
her&quot;; ... &quot;<i>Whoop, do me no harm, good man.</i>&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>L. 212.</p>

<p><i>Clo.</i> Pr'ythee, bring him in, and let him <i>approach
singing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Perdita.</i> Forewarn him, that he use <i>no scurrilous words</i>
in 's tunes.</p>

<p>L. 259.</p>

<p><i>Clo.</i> [to Autolycus]. What hast here? <i>ballads</i>?</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> 'Pray now, buy some: I love a <i>ballad in print</i>, o'
life, for <i>then we are sure they are true</i>.</p>

<p><i>Autolycus.</i> Here's one to a <i>very doleful tune</i> ... [of a
usurer's wife].</p>

<p>L. 273.</p>

<p><i>Clo.</i> Come on, lay it by: and let's first see <i>more
ballads</i>....</p>

<p><i>Aut.</i> Here's <i>another ballad, of a fish</i>, that ... sung
this ballad against the hard hearts of maids: ... the ballad
is <i>very pitiful</i>, and as true.</p>

<p>L. 285.</p>

<p><i>Clo.</i> Lay it by too: another.</p>

<p><i>Aut.</i> This is a <i>merry ballad</i>, but a <i>very pretty</i> one.</p>

<p><i>Mop.</i> Let's have some merry ones.</p>

<p><i>Aut.</i> Why, this is a passing merry one, and <i>goes to the
tune of</i> &quot;Two maids wooing a man,&quot; there's scarce a maid
westward but she sings it: <i>'tis in request</i>, I can tell
you.</p>

<p><i>Mop.</i> We can <i>both</i> sing it: if <i>thou'lt bear a part</i>
[<i>i.e.</i>, Autolycus], thou shalt hear; 'tis in <i>three parts</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dorcas.</i> We had the <i>tune</i> on't a month ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aut.</i> <i>I can bear my part</i>; you must know, <i>'tis my
occupation</i>: have at it with you.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">[They sing 'Get you hence,' in three parts.]</p>

<p><i>Clo.</i> We'll have the song out anon <i>by ourselves</i>.</p>

<p>L. 328.</p>

<p><i>Servant.</i> Master, there is <i>three</i> carters, <i>three</i>
shepherds, <i>three</i> neat herds, <i>three</i> swine herds, that
have made themselves all <i>men of hair</i>: they call themselves
<i>Saltiers</i>; and they have a <i>dance</i>, which the wenches say
is a <i>gallimaufry</i> of gambols, because they are not in't....</p>

<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>

<p>L. 609.</p>

<p><i>Aut.</i> <i>My clown</i> (who wants but something to be a
reasonable man) grew so in love with the wenches' <i>song</i>,
that he would not stir his pettitoes, <i>till he had both tune
and words</i>.</p></div>

<p>The tabor and pipe, in the servant's first speech, were common popular
instruments. The tabor, of course, was a small drum, which was used as
accompaniment to the pipe, a small whistle with three holes, but with
a compass of 18 notes. (See <a href="#DESCRIPTION_OF_FRONTISPIECE">Frontispiece</a>.) In its curiously
disproportionate compass, it may be compared to the modern 'Picco'
pipe of the music shops. Mersennus (middle of 17th century) mentions
an Englishman, John Price, who was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> accomplished player. It is
played on by Ariel, see a subsequent quotation from <i>The Tempest</i> III,
ii, 126 and 152. Also <i>Much Ado</i> II, iii, 13; and the tabor alone, in
<i>Twelfth Night</i> III, i.</p>

<p>The Bagpipe<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> was very similar to the instruments of that name which
still exist. At the present moment there are four kinds in
use&#8212;Highland Scotch, Lowland Scotch, Northumbrian, and Irish. The
last has bellows instead of a 'bag,' but in other ways they are very
much alike. They all have 'drones,' which sound a particular note or
notes continually, while the tune is played on the 'chanter.'
Shakespeare himself tells us of another variety&#8212;viz., the
Lincolnshire bagpipe, in <i>Hen. 4. A.</i> I, ii, 76, where Falstaff
compares his low spirits to the melancholy 'drone of a Lincolnshire
bagpipe.'<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The servant's second speech refers to the character of the words of
the popular ballads, which were too often coarse and even indecent.</p>

<p>'Love-songs' are quite a large class, frequently referred to. For
instance, <i>Two Gent.</i> II, i, 15.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Val.</i> Why, how know you that I am in love?<br />
<br />
<i>Speed.</i> Marry by these special marks.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">First, you have learn'd ...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>To relish a love song</i>, like a robin-redbreast;</span><br />
</p></div>

<p><i>Rom.</i> II, iv, 15.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Mercutio.</i> 'Alas, poor Romeo! he is already dead;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">... run thorough the ear <i>with a love-song</i>.'</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>besides the passage from <i>Twelfth Nt.</i> II, iii, quoted further on,
where Feste offers Sir Toby and Sir Andrew their choice between 'a
love-song, or a song of good life.'</p>

<p>The 'delicate burdens,' 'dildos and fadings,' 'jump her and thump
her,' are to be found in examples of the period. A Round of Matt.
White, 'The Courtier scorns the country clowns' (date about 1600) has
for its third and last line 'With a fading, fading, fading, fading,'
etc. 'Whoop, do me no harm' has already been spoken of.</p>

<p>In l. 214 of the <i>Winter's Tale</i> passage, Perdita again takes
precaution against Autolycus using 'scurrilous words.'</p>

<p>From l. 285 to l. 327, the passage refers to a very interesting
department of 16th century singing&#8212;viz., the habit of performing
songs in three vocal parts. The singers were called Threeman-songmen,
and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> songs themselves 'Threeman songs,' or 'Freemen's Songs.'
[<i>Freemen</i> is simply a corruption of <i>Threemen</i>. Mr Aldis Wright tells
me it is analogous to <i>Thills</i> or <i>Fills</i>, for the shafts of a waggon.
Rimbault, in the preface to 'Rounds, Canons, and Catches,' is highly
indignant with Ritson's 'inconceivably strange notion' that Freemen is
only a form of Threemen. Rimbault's reason was that 'Deuteromelia'
(1609) does contain Freemen's Songs in <i>four</i> parts. Mr Aldis Wright
also gives me the expression '<i>six</i>-men's song,' from Percy's
Reliques, also these definitions, which will all go to settle the
matter: Florio, Italian Dictionary, 1611; <i>Strambotti</i>, country
gigges, rounds, catches, virelaies or <i>threemen's songs</i>; <i>Cantarini</i>,
such as sing <i>threemen's songs</i>; <i>Berlingozzo</i>.... Also a drunken or
<i>threemen's song</i>.</p>

<p>Cotgrave, French Dict. 1611; Virelay. m. A virelay, round, <i>free</i>mans
song].</p>

<p>Giraldus Cambrensis says that singing in parts was indigenous to the
parts beyond the Humber, and on the borders of Yorkshire. Threeman
singing may still be heard (not as an exotic), in Wales and the West
of England. This last is referred to in the above passage, 'There's
scarce a maid westward but she sings it'&#8212;viz., the song in three
parts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Shakespeare is strictly historical in making a pedlar, and two country
lasses, capable of 'bearing a part' in a composition of this sort.</p>

<p>The company of 'men of hair,' calling themselves 'Saltiers,' may
derive their name from the dance, 'Saltarello.' Gallimaufry is
'Galimathias,' a muddle, or hotch potch. (See <i>Merry Wives</i> II, i,
115).</p>

<p>The threemansong men are more particularly described in <i>Winter's
Tale</i> IV, ii, 41.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Clown.</i> She hath made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the
<i>shearers; three-man song-men all, and very good ones</i>, but
they are <i>most of them means and bases</i>; but <i>one Puritan</i>
amongst them, and he <i>sings psalms to hornpipes</i>.</p></div>

<p>These musical harvesters square closely with the account given in the
<a href="#INTRODUCTORY">Introduction</a>, of music amongst the lower classes. Here were 24 good
glee singers, with the single defect that their tenors were very weak,
'most of them means [altos] and basses.' The Puritan was most
accommodating, and his singing the words of psalms to the tune of the
hornpipe would tend to shew that the Old Adam was not all put away as
yet. His compromise with his conscience reminds one of the old stories
(all too true) of church singers in the 15th and 16th centuries, who
would sing the by no means respectable words of popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> comic ditties
to the solemn strains of the mass 'l'homme arm&#233;,' or whatever
well-known melody the music happened to be constructed on.</p>

<p>An example of a threemansong will be found in the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>, 'We be
soldiers three.'</p>

<p>Shakespeare also alludes to <i>sacred</i> part-music. Falstaff, by his own
account, was a notable singer of Anthems, in which holy service he had
lost his voice; he was familiar with members of the celebrated choir
of St George's Chapel at Windsor; and was not above practising the
metrical Psalmody in his sadder moments.</p>

<p><i>H. 4. B.</i> I, ii, 182.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Chief Justice.</i> Is not your <i>voice broken</i>, your wind
short, your chin double, your wit single, and every part
about you blasted with antiquity, and will you yet call
yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> My lord.... For my <i>voice</i>, I have <i>lost it
with</i> hollaing, and <i>singing of anthems</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>H. 4. B.</i> II, i, 88.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Hostess.</i> Thou didst swear to me ... upon Wednesday in
Wheeson week, when the prince broke thy head for liking his
father to a <i>singing-man of Windsor</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Hen. 4. A.</i> II, iv, 137. Falstaff laments the degeneracy of the
times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Fal.</i> There live not three good men unhanged in England,
and one of them is fat, and grows old; God help the while! a
bad world, I say. <i>I would I were a weaver; I could sing
psalms or anything.</i></p></div>

<p>This last sentence connects curiously with Sir John Oldcastle, the
leader of the Lollards, who were noted for their psalm singing, which
indeed gave them the name. These Flemish Protestants, who had fled
from the persecutions in their own country, were mostly <i>woollen</i>
manufacturers, and were distinguished for their love of Psalmody,
throughout the western counties, where they settled. Hence the
allusion to 'weavers' and 'Psalms.' But according to the Epilogue of
<i>Hen. 4. B.</i>, 'Oldcastle died a martyr, and <i>this is not the man</i>.'</p>

<p>Falstaff knew well what a Ballad was too&#8212;as the following shews:&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Hen. 4. A.</i> II, ii, 43.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Fal.</i> (to Hal.). Go hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I have not
<i>ballads made on you all</i>, and <i>sung to filthy tunes</i>, let a
cup of sack be my poison.</p></div>

<p>Two other worthy knights claim our attention in the next quotation,
which contains many interesting allusions. <i>Inter alia</i>; Sir Toby
gives Feste sixpence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> to sing a song; Sir Andrew follows it up with a
'testril.' The Clown then sings them 'O mistress mine.' [For the
original music see Prof. Bridge's 'Shakespeare Songs,' Novello, a
collection which every reader of Shakespeare ought to have. Price 2s.
6d.] Then, at Sir Toby's suggestion, they all three sing a catch, or,
in his own words, 'draw <i>three</i> souls out of <i>one</i> weaver,' an
allusion to the <i>three</i> vocal parts which are evolved from the <i>one</i>
melody of the catch, as well as a sly reference to 'weavers' singing
catches. (See <a href="#INTRODUCTORY">Introduction</a>.) They sing 'Thou knave,' for which see the
<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>. It is not a good catch, but sounds humorous if done smartly,
and perhaps its very roughness suits the circumstances. Next, after
Maria's entrance, Toby either quotes the titles, or sings odd lines of
four old songs [<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>]; and when Malvolio comes in, furious with
the noise they are making in the middle of the night, he applies
precisely those epithets to their proceedings that our histories lead
us to expect&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, 'gabbling like <i>tinkers</i>,' '<i>alehouse</i>,'
squeaking out your '<i>cozier's</i> catches' ['cozier' is 'cobbler']. Sir
Toby's puns on 'keep time' in ll. 94 and 115 ought not to be missed.
To 'keep time' is almost the only virtue a catch singer <i>must</i> have.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>L. 103-114, another song, &quot;Farewell, dear heart&quot; [<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>].</p>

<p>It is perhaps necessary to explain the nature of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> Catch, or Round,
more clearly. The two names were interchangeable in the 16th and 17th
centuries. It was not till quite modern times that 'Catch' implied a
necessary quibble in the words, deliberately arranged by the writer.
First, a Catch or Round of the best type of Elizabethan times
consisted of <i>one melody</i>, generally perfectly continuous. Secondly,
the said melody was always divisible into a certain number of <i>equal
sections</i>, varying from three to six, or even eight; and as many
sections as there were, so many voices were necessary. Thirdly, each
of these equal sections was deliberately arranged so as to make
<i>Harmony</i> with every other.</p>

<p>Here are the words of a Round of the 17th century, which is divisible
into three equal sections, and therefore is sung by three voices.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
1. 'Cuckoo! Hark! how he sings to us.<br />
2. Good news the cuckoo brings to us;<br />
3. Spring is here, says the cuckoo.'<br />
</p></div>

<p>Now, the way for three persons, A, B, and C, to sing this Catch or
Round, is as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p>A begins [see above, line 69, '<i>Begin</i>, fool'] line 1, and immediately
proceeds to line 2; at this very instant, B in his turn begins line 1,
and acts similarly. When A has reached the first syllable in line 3,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> B is at 'Good' in line 2, it is time for C also to begin at line
1. As soon as A has finished line 3, he begins again; and so on with
the others&#8212;'round' and 'round' till they are tired of 'catching' each
other up.</p>

<p>Thus when they are all three fairly set going, their <i>one</i> melody
produces <i>three part</i> harmony, and the catchers have drawn 'three
souls out of one weaver.'</p>

<p>The principle in all other Catches or Rounds is exactly the same,
however great the number of parts.</p>

<p>In the following we have another case of catch-singing. The original
music of 'Flout 'em' has not come down to us.</p>

overjoyed to think that he will have all his music 'for nothing' (l.

<h3><span class="smcap">Serenades and 'Music'</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Serenades is as ancient as that of Songs. In the middle
of the 15th century, Sebastian Brant, a lawyer, wrote in Dutch his
'Stultifera Navis,' or 'Ship of Fools,' a severe satire on things in
general, and popular amusements in particular. The book was afterwards
translated into Latin, and thence into English. Here are some of the
verses that treat of Serenades in the year 1450.</p>

<p>Thus, one hundred years before Shakespeare was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> born, Serenades of
voices and instruments were common, and in general practice by all
classes of young men, and not only laymen, but also yonge fooles of
the spiritualtie.</p>

<p>The instruments mentioned are such as were still in use in
Shakespeare's time&#8212;viz., harp, lute, 'foolish' pipe, bagpipe, and
'foolish' flute, besides the several varieties of song, which
evidently included both solo and part singing&#8212;'feigned' ballads for a
single voice [ballads, that is, in the more refined 'keys' of 'Musica
Ficta'], and 'Countering,' which implies that two voices at least took
part.</p>

<p>The following passage is an example of this nocturnal serenading by a
company of gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Two Gent.</i> III, ii, 83.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Proteus</i> (advises Thurio)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Visit by night your lady's chamber window</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With some <i>sweet concert</i>: to their <i>instruments</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Tune a <i>deploring dump</i>:'</span><br />
<br />
<i>Thu.</i> And thy advice this night I'll put in practice.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Let us into the city presently,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>To sort some gentlemen well skilled in music</i>.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Proteus advises Thurio to get a 'consort' (probably of viols) to play
a 'dump' under Silvia's window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> He goes to arrange for some of his
friends to attend for this purpose. The serenade takes place in the
next Act, where, in the 2nd scene, line 17, it is called 'evening
music,' but does not include the 'dump,' for Thurio has 'a sonnet that
will serve the turn,' so they sing 'Who is Silvia.'</p>

<p>Here is the passage, which is full of quibbles on musical terms.</p>

<p><i>Two Gent.</i> IV, ii, 16.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Proteus.</i> ... 'Now must we to her window,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And give <i>some evening music to her ear</i>.'</span><br />
<br />
L. 24.<br />
<br />
<i>Thu.</i> ... Now, gentlemen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Let's tune.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>L. 28.</p>

<p><i>Host</i> (to Julia, in boy's clothes). I'll bring you where
you shall <i>hear music</i>, and see the gentleman that you ask'd
for.</p>

<p><i>Jul.</i> But shall I <i>hear him speak</i>?</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> Ay, that you shall.</p>

<p><i>Jul.</i> <i>That will be music.</i></p>

<p>L. 54.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> How do you, man? (<i>i.e.</i>, Julia) the <i>music likes
you not</i>.</p>

<p><i>Jul.</i> You mistake: the <i>musician</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, Proteus) <i>likes
me not</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Host.</i> Why, my pretty youth?</p>

<p><i>Jul.</i> He <i>plays false</i>, father.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> How? <i>out of tune on the strings</i>?</p>

<p><i>Jul.</i> Not so; but yet <i>so false</i>, that he grieves my very
<i>heart-strings</i>.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> You have a <i>quick ear</i>.</p>

<p><i>Jul.</i> Ay; I would I were deaf! it makes me have a <i>slow
heart</i>.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> I perceive, <i>you delight not in music</i>.</p>

<p><i>Jul.</i> Not a whit, when it <i>jars</i> so.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> Hark! what fine <i>change</i> is in the music.</p>

<p><i>Jul.</i> Ay, that <i>change</i> (Proteus' unfaithfulness) is the
spite.</p>

<p><i>Host</i> (misunderstanding again). You would have them
<i>always</i> play but <i>one thing</i>?</p>

<p><i>Jul.</i> I would always have <i>one</i> (Proteus) play but one
thing.</p>

<p>L. 85.</p>

<p><i>Silvia</i> (from window). 'I thank you for your music,
gentlemen.'</p></div>

<p>The next passage is of a serenade in the early morning. Cloten
arranges for the musicians (who seem in this case to be professional
players) to give two pieces, one instrumental, followed by a song.</p>

<p><i>Cymbeline</i> II, iii, 11. Cloten serenades Imogen.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Cloten.</i> I would this <i>music would come</i>. I am advised to
give her <i>music o' mornings</i>; they say, it will penetrate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter Musicians.</i></p>

<p>Come on: <i>tune</i>. If you can penetrate her with your
<i>fingering</i>, so; we'll try with <i>tongue</i> too: ... <i>First</i>, a
very excellent good-conceited thing; <i>after</i>, a wonderful
sweet air, with admirable rich words to it,&#8212;<i>and then</i> let
her consider.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">[The musicians perform 'Hark! hark! the lark.']</p>

<p>So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your
<i>music the better</i>; if it do not, it is a vice in <i>her
ears</i>, which <i>horse-hairs</i>, and <i>calves'-guts</i>, ... can
never amend.</p></div>

<p>In l. 14, 'fingering' and 'tongue' correspond to 'playing' and
'singing.' The first is to be a 'Fancy' for viols, 'a very excellent
good-conceited thing'; the second is the 'wonderful sweet air,' Hark!
hark! the lark.</p>

<p>'Good-conceited' means having many 'conceits.' These 'fancies' were
always contrapuntal, and the various artificial contrivances,
answering of points, imitations, and what not, are referred to under
this title. The mention of 'horse-hairs and calves'-guts' makes it
clear that the instruments in this 'morning music' were Viols.</p>

<p>Another 'evening music' is provided by Pericles, Prince of Tyre.</p>

<p><i>Pericles</i> II, v, 24. Pericles, a musician [his education had been 'in
<i>arts</i> and arms,' see II, iii, 82].<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Per.</i> All fortune to the good Simonides!<br />
<br />
<i>Sim.</i> To you as much, sir! <i>I am beholding to you</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>For your sweet music this last night</i>: I do</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Protest, my ears were never better fed</span><br />

<br />
<i>Per.</i> The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.<br />
</p></div>

<p>The next quotation is also of 'morning music,' but with a different
object&#8212;not a lady, but a soldier, and of a somewhat rough and ready
kind, to judge by the Clown's critical remarks.</p>

<p>The passage seems to indicate the use of Bagpipes; for 'they speak in
the <i>nose</i>' (see <i>Merchant</i> IV, i, 48), and are called
<i>wind</i>-instruments, and are mentioned under the name 'pipes' in the
last two lines. Moreover, there is the remark of the Clown,
represented here by stars, which is terribly appropriate to that
instrument.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Cass.</i> Masters, <i>play here</i>; I will content your pains:

<p><i>Clo.</i> ... masters, here's money for you; and <i>the general

<p><i>1 Mus.</i> Well, sir, we will not.</p>

<p><i>Clo.</i> If you have <i>any music that may not be heard</i>, to't

<p><i>Clo.</i> Then <i>put up your pipes in your bag</i>, for I'll away.

<p>Pandarus appears to be a capital musician. In the following we find
him questioning a musical servant of Priam's palace about some
instrumental music which is going on within, 'at the request of
Paris.' The servant amuses himself by giving 'cross' answers to
Pandarus' crooked questions, and in the process gets out two or three
musical jokes&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, '<i>partly</i> know,' 'music <i>in parts</i>,' '<i>wholly</i>,
sir.' Further on, Paris also plays on the term 'broken' music.</p>

<p>L. 52.</p>

<p><i>Pan.</i> Fair prince, here is <i>good broken music</i>.</p>

<p>L. 95.</p>

<p><i>Pan.</i> ... Come, <i>give me an instrument</i>. [And at Helen's
request, Pandarus sings, 'Love, love, nothing but love.']</p></div>

<p>The custom of having instrumental music in taverns has already been
referred to in the <a href="#INTRODUCTORY">Introduction</a>, near the end, where we learn that the
charge for playing before the guests was twenty shillings for two
hours in Shakespeare's time; also that a man could hardly go into a
public house of entertainment without being followed by two or three
itinerant musicians, who would either sing or play for his pleasure,
while he was at dinner. Accordingly, we find Sir John Falstaff
enjoying such a performance at the Boar's Head, Eastcheap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p><i>H. 4. B.</i> II, iv, 10.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1 Drawer.</i> Why then, cover, and set them down: and see if
thou canst find out <i>Sneak's noise</i>; Mistress Tearsheet
would fain have <i>some music</i>. (After supper, in a cooler
room.)</p>

<p><i>Id.</i> l. 227.</p>

<p><i>Fal.</i> <i>Pay the musicians</i>, sirrah.</p></div>

<p>The term 'Sneak's noise' is most interesting. 'Noise' means a company
of musicians, and Mr Sneak was the gentleman who gave his name to the
particular band of instrumentalists who favoured the Boar's Head.</p>

<p>Milton uses the word, in this sense, in the poem 'At a Solemn Music,'
where the 'saintly shout' of the seraphic choir, with 'loud uplifted
angel-trumpets,' 'immortal harps of golden wires,' and the singing of
psalms and hymns, are collectively called 'that melodious <i>noise</i>.'
Also in his Hymn on the Nativity, verse ix., he has 'string&#232;d
<i>noise</i>'&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, band of stringed instruments. The Prayer-book
Version (Great Bible) of the Psalms, which was made in 1540, has the
word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> in Ps. lxxxi. 1, 'Make a cheerful <i>noise</i> unto the God of
Jacob,' and this in the next verses is said to consist of various
musical instruments&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, the tabret, harp, lute, and trumpet. Also
in the Authorised Version of 1611, Ps. xxxiii. 3, 'play skilfully with
a loud <i>noise</i>,' which was the instrumental accompaniment to a 'new
song.' The same word is used in several other places, with the meaning
of 'music'&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, Pss. lxvi. 1; xcv. 1, 2; xcviii. 4, 6; c. 1; where
'to make a joyful noise' is represented in the original by the same
verb, except in one of the two cases in Ps. xcviii. 4.</p>

<p>The word was still in use in 1680, when Dr Plot was present at the
annual Bull-running held by the Minstrels of Tutbury, one of the
features of which festivity was a banquet, with 'a Noise of musicians
playing to them.'</p>

<p>The reputed cure of the Tarantula's bite by music has already been
mentioned. The next three examples are of somewhat similar cases.</p>

<p>In the first, Henry IV. in sickness asks for music; the second is an
account of Cerimon's attempt to rouse the half-drowned Thaisa with at
least partial assistance from music; while the third represents
Prospero using a solemn air to remove the magic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> spell which he had
cast on Alonso and his other enemies.</p>

<p>Next we have two examples of 'Music at Home.' In the case of the Duke
in Twelfth Night, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> 'concerted' music, and the players seem to be
performing such a quaint old piece as 'The Lord of Salisbury his
Pavin,' by Gibbons, in <i>Parthenia</i>, the last 'strain' of which has
just such a 'dying fall' as is mentioned in line 4. [See the remarks
on the passage from <i>Lucrece</i> in <a href="#I">Section I.</a> on the <i>technical</i> meaning
of 'strain.']</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Sing, and disperse them</i>, if thou canst. Leave working.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p style="text-align: center">[Song. 'Orpheus.']</p>

<p>The next passage brings us to another class of music&#8212;viz., dirges,
funeral songs, or 'good-nights.' [See <i>H. 4. B.</i> III, ii, 322]. In
<i>Cymbeline</i> IV, ii, 184, Cadwal (Arviragus) sounds an 'ingenious
instrument' to signify Imogen's death. Polydore (Guiderius) says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> they
had not used it since their mother died. The song, or more properly,
duet, which they sing directly after, in memory of Imogen, may be
taken in this connection. Unfortunately there seems to be no musical
setting of 'Fear no more the heat o' the sun' any older than 1740.</p>

<p>In the following quotation 'dirges' are mentioned by name.</p>

<p><i>Rom.</i> IV, iv, 21.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Capulet.</i> ... &quot;Good faith! 'tis day:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The county [Count Paris] will be here <i>with music</i> straight.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
Sc. v. 84.<br />
<br />
<i>Cap.</i> All things, that we ordained festival,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Turn from their office to black funeral:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our <i>instruments</i> to <i>melancholy bells</i>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our <i>solemn hymns</i> to <i>sullen dirges</i> change.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>In close connection with these funeral songs is the passage in <i>Hen.
VIII.</i> IV, ii, 77, where Queen Katherine, sick, requests her
gentleman-usher to get the musicians to play a favourite piece of this
class&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">... Good Griffith,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Cause the musicians play me <i>that sad note</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>I named my knell</i>, whilst I sit meditating</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On that celestial harmony I go to.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">[She sleeps, then, waking from the vision&#8212;]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">... Bid the music leave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They are harsh and heavy to me.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>It would be of great interest if it were possible to identify Queen
Katherine's 'Knell.'</p>

<p>There is an old song, given in Chappell's Popular Music, 'O Death,
rock me to sleep,' which might be the very one, for both music and
words are singularly appropriate. The Refrain is as follows:&#8212;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
'Tole on thou passing bell<br />
Ringe out my dolefull <i>knell</i><br />
Let thy sound my death tell,<br />
For I must die,<br />
There is no remedye.'
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The song is most plaintive, and has a very striking feature in the
shape of a real independent accompaniment, which keeps up a continual
figure of three descending notes, like the bells of a village church.
Hawkins gives the poem, with certain variations, and two extra verses
at the beginning, the first commencing&#8212;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
'Defil&#233;d is my name full sore,<br />
Through cruel spite and false report.'
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>and he says the verses are thought to have been written by Anne
Boleyn. Hawkins also gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> music (in four parts) to the first two
verses, by Robt. Johnson, a contemporary of Shakespeare's. The music
of the song in Chappell is much older than that; indeed, it is very
possibly of Hen. VIII.'s time.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dances and Dancing</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Dances is the history of the transition from pure vocal
music to pure instrumental music. In the Dances of the 16th century,
we have the germs of the modern 'Sonata' Form; and in the association
of certain of them we have the first attempt at a sequence of
different 'movements,' which finally resulted in the Sonata itself.</p>

<p>The Elizabethan Dances, especially the Pavan, shew us this development
just at the point where instrumental music was dividing itself from
vocal.</p>

<p><i>All the ancient dances were originally sung.</i> In Grove's Dictionary,
Vol. ii. p. 676, there is given the music of a <i>Pavan</i>, in four vocal
parts, with the words sung [copied from Arbeau's Orch&#233;sographie,
1588]. Morley (Practical Music, 1597) mentions <i>Ballete</i>, as being
'songs which being sung to a dittie may likewise be danced.' Again, he
speaks of 'a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> songs ... called Justinianas ... all written in
the <i>Bergamasca</i> language.' See <i>Mids. Nt. Dream</i> V, ii, 30, where
Bottom is not so very inaccurate after all in asking Duke Theseus to
'<i>hear</i> a Bergomask dance between two of our company.' The same author
also gives '<i>Passamesos</i> with a dittie [<i>i.e.</i>, sung],' and
distinguishes between these aforesaid and 'those kinds which they make
<i>without</i> ditties.' [Passamesos are Passing-measures&#8212;or
Passamezzo&#8212;Pavans, see <i>Twelfth Nt.</i> V, i, 200.]</p>

<p>Hence it appears that in Elizabeth's reign some dances were sung, and
others were simply played.</p>

<p>Morley goes on to instance two particular dances which were commonly
associated together&#8212;viz., <i>Pavans</i> and <i>Galliards</i>. [<i>Tw.</i> V, i, 200,
I, iii, 127, etc., <i>H. 5.</i> I, ii, 252], the first of which he says is
for 'grave' dancing, having three 'strains,' each containing 8, 12, or
16 semibreves (two beats in a bar), which are each repeated; and that
this <i>Pavan</i> is usually followed by a <i>Galliard</i>, 'a kind of music
made out of the other' [see Bull's Pavan and Galliard, 'St Thomas
Wake,' in <i>Parthenia</i>] in <i>triple</i> time, 'a lighter and more stirring
dance than the <i>Pavan</i>, and consisting of the same number of
straines.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>The next passage from Morley is very interesting when compared with
the stage direction in <i>Timon</i> I, ii, 131, where a <i>masque</i> of
<i>Ladies</i> as <i>Amazons</i> enter the banquetting hall at Timon's house,
with <i>lutes</i> in their hands, <i>dancing and playing</i>. This stage
direction corresponds closely with Morley's account, 'the Italians
make their <i>galliards</i> (which they tearm <i>salta relly</i>) plain'
[<i>i.e.</i>, alone; not as an appendage to the Pavan, as in England], 'and
frame ditties to them, which in their <i>mascaradoes</i> they sing and
dance, and manie times without any instruments at all, but instead of
instruments they have <i>Curtisans disguised</i> in men's apparell, who
sing <i>and daunce</i> to their own songes.'</p>

<p>The 'French <i>bransle</i>,' he says, is like the Alman (Allemagne of Bach,
etc.)&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, it 'containeth the time of eight, and most commonly in
short notes.' This is the Brawl, see <i>L.L.L.</i> III, i, 9, and was one
of several tunes to which the Country Dance was danced, whether in a
ring, or 'at length,' like our 'Sir Roger.'</p>

<p>He says that the '<i>voltes</i> and <i>courantes</i>' also are 'like unto this,'
but are 'danced after sundrie fashions' [he means, with different
steps, but occupying the same rhythmical time, so that the same tune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
would do], 'the <i>volte</i> rising and leaping, the <i>courant</i> travising
and running, in which measure also our Countrey dance is made, though
it be danced after <i>another form</i> than any of the former.'</p>

<p>'All these be made in <i>straines</i>, either two or three.' See <i>Tw.</i> I,
i, 4, 'that <i>strain</i> again,' or <i>Julius C&#230;sar</i> IV, iii, 258, 'touch
thy instrument a <i>strain</i> or two.'</p>

<p>Christopher Sympson, the royalist soldier (1667), confirms Morley's
statements as to the constitution and use of these dances. See his
'Compendium,' p. 116, where he expressly states that pure instrumental
music, 'made only to delight the ear,' is merely a development from
Dances.</p>

<p>He speaks of the association of Pavan and Galliard as being 'in
course.' He spells the latter <i>Giliard</i>, and says that it is
'according to its name' [see Skeat, Etym. Dict., Spanish, gallardo (ll
= ly), pleasant, gay, lively] 'of a loftly and frolick movement.'
Immediately afterwards, however, Sympson seems to forget his own
remarks, for he says the name is derived from Gallia, 'the country
whence it came.'</p>

<p>On page 117 he speaks of <i>Corants</i>, <i>Sarabands</i>, <i>Jiggs</i>, <i>Country
Dances</i>, etc., as 'things so common in each one's ears' that he 'need
not enlarge his Discourse' to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a capital bit of patriotism on page 118, which deserves
quoting, first, because at the time it was entirely justifiable;
secondly, because it shews us that in 1667, instrumental music had at
last decidedly parted company with vocal part-writing, and had an
independent existence. 'You need not seek Outlandish Authors,
especially for Instrumental <i>Music</i>; no Nation (in my opinion) being
equal to the <i>English</i> in that way; as well for their excellent as
their various and numerous Consorts, of 3, 4, 5, and 6 Parts, made
properly [on purpose] for Instruments, of all which (as I said)
<i>Fancies</i> are the chief.' For 'Consort,' see <i>Two Gent.</i> III, ii, 83;
and for 'Fancies,' <i>Hen. IV. B.</i> III, ii, 323.</p>

<p>Hawkins (1776) does not add much of interest to the above account of
the Elizabethan dances, except (p. 704) that there is no authority for
a Jigg having generally a pointed (<i>i.e.</i>, dotted) note at the
beginning of every bar. There is, however, a 'Jegge' given in Stainer
and Barrett's Dict. of Musical Terms, dated 1678, where the 'pointed'
note is quite characteristic. This may be a more modern feature, for
an undoubtedly ancient Jig&#8212;viz., Dr Bull's 'King's Hunting Jigg,' not
only has no dotted note, but is in common time, without even a
tendency towards the rhythm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> of triplets. [Also see
<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>,
'Cobbler's Jig.' 1622.]</p>

<p>Here is a most entertaining quotation from Selden,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> dealing with
fashionable court dances in Elizabeth's reign, and shewing how things
had gone from bad to worse in respect of dignity and state in dancing,
under the Stuarts.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The court of England is much alter'd. At a solemn dancing,
<i>first</i> you had the <i>grave measures</i>, <i>then</i> the <i>Corantoes</i>
and the <i>Galliards</i>, and <i>this</i> kept up <i>with ceremony</i>; and
<i>at length</i> to Trenchmore, and the Cushion dance: <i>Then</i> all
the company dances, lord and groom, lady and kitchen-maid,
<i>no distinction</i>. So in our court in queen <i>Elizabeth's</i>
time, <i>gravity and state</i> were kept up. In king <i>James's</i>
time things were <i>pretty well</i>. But <i>in king Charles's
time</i>, there has been nothing but Trenchmore and the
Cushion-dance, <i>omnium gatherum, tolly polly, hoite cum
toite</i>.'</p></div>

<p>There are very many passages of interest, containing references to
Dances. The first one here given is an instance (in Shakespeare's very
text) of singing a dance and dancing to it at the same time. Here the
<i>Brawl</i>, and <i>Canary</i>, the first in alphabetical order, are coupled
together.</p>

<p><i>L.L.L.</i> III, i, 9.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Moth.</i> Master, will you win your love with a <i>French
brawl</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> How meanest thou? <i>brawling in French</i>?</p>

<p><i>Moth.</i> No, my complete master; but to <i>jig off a tune</i> at
the tongue's end, <i>canary to it</i> with your feet, ... <i>sigh a
note</i>, and <i>sing a note</i>.'</p></div>

<p>Two other examples of dancing to one's own singing are, <i>Mids.</i> V, ii,
25 and <i>Wiv.</i> V, v, 93.</p>

<p>The <i>Brawl</i> was written in quick four-in-a-bar time. There are several
well-known tunes to it. [See <a href="#ORCHESOGRAPHIE">Note on Arbeau's 'Orch&#233;sographie.'</a> 1588.]
The derivation of the name is from the French, <i>bransle</i>, a totter,
swing, shake, etc., or perhaps from Old French <i>Brandeler</i>, to wag,
shake, swing. Skeat thinks the original dance may have been a <i>sword</i>
dance, and with this he connects the word Brandish.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It was danced,
sometimes in a ring, holding hands, and sometimes 'at length.'</p>

<p>The <i>Canary</i> (or Canaries) was in 6/8 time, and was a lively dance.
[Stainer and Barrett's Dict. gives one by Delaborde in 4/4 time.]
There are many examples by Lully and other Frenchmen of the 17th
century. One of Lully's, in Lajarte's 'Airs &#224; Danser,' dates 1666.
There is no history of the name. Skeat says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> it is so called from the
Canary Islands. Hawkins does not attempt to account for the title, but
cunningly infers that it is of English origin because it has <i>not</i> got
a foreign name. Also he mentions that Purcell wrote a Canaries for his
Opera of Dioclesian, 1690. [See <a href="#ORCHESOGRAPHIE">Note on 'Orch&#233;sographie.'</a>]</p>

<p>The Canary is also alluded to in two other places, where the lively
character of the dance is clear. Mr Ford puns on 'wine,' 'pipe,' and
'canary.' Of course <i>he</i> means <i>whine</i>, <i>pipe</i> (for dancing to), and
the <i>Canary</i> that he meant Falstaff to dance.</p>

<p><i>Wiv.</i> III, ii, 83.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Host.</i> Farewell, my hearts. I will to my honest knight
Falstaff, and drink <i>canary</i> with him.</p>

<p><i>Ford.</i> [<i>aside</i>] I think, I shall drink in <i>pipe-wine</i>
first with him; I'll make him <i>dance</i>.</p></div>

<p>And next, Lafeu connects the canary with 'spritely fire and motion.'</p>

<p><i>All's Well</i> II, i, 74.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Lafeu.</i> ... I have seen a medicine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That's able to breathe life into a stone,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With spritely fire and motion.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>There are two specially important passages which mention several
dances at one time, so as to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> some prominence to their special
characteristics&#8212;viz., <i>Much Ado</i> II, i, 68, and <i>Twelfth Nt.</i> I, iii,
118.</p>

<p>The budget of dances here named includes&#8212;</p>

<p>1. Cinque-pace, or Sinkapace. 2. Coranto, or Courante. 3. Galliard. 4.
Jig (Scotch). 5. Measure.</p>

<p><i>Much Ado</i> II, i, 68.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Beatrice.</i> The fault will be in the <i>music</i>, cousin, if you

<i>mannerly modest</i>, as a <i>measure</i>, full of <i>state and
ancientry</i>; and then comes repentance, and with his bad legs
falls into the <i>cinque-pace faster and faster</i> till he sink
into his grave.</p></div>

virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of
thy leg, it was formed under the <i>star of a galliard</i>.</p></div>

<p>To take these five dances in order&#8212;</p>

<p>1. Cinquepace is the name of the original Galliard. Praetorius (b.
1571) says a Galliard has <i>five</i> steps, and is therefore called
<i>Cinque</i> Pas. These five steps are described in the Orch&#233;sographie,
1588. See the Note on that work for the explanation of the steps of
this and other Shakespeare dances.</p>

<p>Beatrice's description seems to connect the cinquepace with the
tottering and uncertain steps of old age. 'Repentance,' she says,
'with his <i>bad legs</i> falls into the cinquepace faster and faster, till
he <i>sink</i> into his grave.'</p>

<p>2. Coranto is the Italian form of our Country dance. The Country dance
is original in England, but under different foreign names has been
called French or Italian. It means simply 'country' or 'rustic' dance.
Skeat is entirely opposed to the derivation from <i>Contra</i> danza, with
a supposed reference to two opposite lines of partners; and in this he
is confirmed by Shakespeare, <i>Tempest</i> IV, i, 138, 'country footing.'
The old English name was 'current traverse,' and Morley (1597) speaks
of the Courant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> step as 'travising and running,' which would appear to
connect the Italian word with <i>curro</i>. Sir John Davies (1570-1626), in
his poem 'Orchestra,' identifies Rounds, Corantos, measures, and some
other dances with Country Dances. That is, whatever the rhythm or
speed of the actual tune used, these variously named Country Dances
could be performed to it. Sir Roger de Coverly, our typical English
Country Dance, is in <i>form</i> almost the same as the Brawl, Coranto,
Galliard, or measure. A Courant by Frescobaldi (1591-1640) is in
triple time. As for its 'step,' Davies says it is 'on a triple dactile
foot,' 'close by the ground with sliding passages.' According to Sir
Toby, it would be a quicker and gayer dance than the Galliard, for he
compares the walk to church to the latter; but the more lighthearted
journey back to dinner he likens to the Coranto. The Jig would be even
faster, for Sir Andrew's 'very walk,' that is, his <i>week-day</i> gait,
was to be 'a jig.'</p>

<p>3. The Galliard, in accordance with its derivation, is properly
described in <i>H. 5.</i> I, ii, 252, as a '<i>nimble</i>' galliard. This was
extremely popular, both as a virginal piece and for dancing. There is
quite a long list of Galliards by various composers, in Qu.
Elizabeth's Virginal Book. There are several in <i>Parthenia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> (1611) by
Byrde, Bull, and Gibbons. They are always in triple time, and consist
of either two or three strains of an even number of bars.</p>

<p>Sir Toby seems to connect a Galliard with somewhat violent 'capers.'
He remarks on the 'excellent constitution' of Sir Andrew's leg, 'it
was formed under the star of a galliard.' Sir Andrew complacently
replies, 'Ay, 'tis strong,' upon which Sir Toby proposes to the
foolish knight to give an example of his powers; 'Let me see thee
<i>caper</i>. Ha! <i>higher</i>.' This capering or 'sault majeur' was also a
feature of the 'high lavolt' [La Volta] mentioned in <i>Troilus</i> IV, iv,
84, concerning which Sir John Davies says&#8212;</p>

<p>Also he calls the lavolte 'a lofty jumping.' Morley (1597) speaks of
the Volte, and says it is characterised by 'rising and leaping,' and
is of the same 'measure' as a coranto. These statements do not all
agree with the 'Orch&#233;sographie.'</p>

<p>4. Jigg [later Gigue, and Jig]. The name comes from Giga (Geige), a
sort of fiddle in use during the 12th and 13th centuries. The oldest
jigs are Scottish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> and were 'round dances' for a large number of
people. As for the time of the Jig tunes, those of the 18th century
were certainly written in a triple rhythm, like 3/8, 6/4 or 12/8. The
Jegge of 1678, mentioned above, is in quick 6/4 time. But 'The
Cobbler's Jig' [<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>], 1622, and a Jigg by Matthew Locke, dated
1672, in his 'Compositions for Broken and Whole Consorts of 2, 3, 4,
5, and 6 parts,' are very decidedly in quick 4/4 time, and have no
such characteristics as a 'dotted note' anywhere about them. Moreover,
Bull's 'The King's Hunting Jigg,' is also in quick 4/4 time, with a
similar absence of dotted notes. This last example is probably earlier
than 1600. At any rate it was a lively dance, as we can learn from
Hamlet.</p>

<p><i>Hamlet</i> II, ii, 504. The <i>1st Player</i> recites a speech.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Polonius.</i> This is <i>too long</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> It shall to the barber's, with your
beard.&#8212;Pr'ythee (to the <i>1st Player</i>), say on: <i>he's for a
jig, ... or he sleeps</i>.</p></div>

<p>5. Measure. Beatrice, in the quoted passage from <i>Much Ado About
Nothing</i>, gives a capital idea of the relative speed of the Scotch jig
and the Measure. The jig, she says, is like the lover's wooing, hot,
hasty, and fantastical; the measure, however, is like the Wedding,
mannerly modest, full of state and ancientry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>The term Measure certainly seems to have been used to signify a
particularly staid and formal dance. Selden (see above), at least,
puts 'grave Measures' at the sober beginning of his list, and so goes
on, by easy descent, through the more spirited Coranto, and tolerably
lively Galliard, to the lower depths of the Cushion-Dance, which were
reached towards the close of the evening, when the grave and reverend
Elders may be supposed to have gone to bed.</p>

<p>But, besides this, the word appears to have been used generically,
meaning merely 'a dance.' It was certainly applied to the Passamezzo,
<i>and to other country dances</i>. In <i>H. 8.</i> I, iv, 104, King Henry
says&#8212;</p>

<p>The next passage uses the word for a pun.</p>

<p><i>As You</i> V, iv, 178.</p>

<p>A similar play upon the word is in <i>Richard II.</i> III, iv, 6, where the
queen asks her ladies to propose some sport to drive away care.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>

<p>And l. 209, <i>measure</i>.</p>

<p>Another dance that is frequently referred to is the Dump, the slow and
mournful character of which has already been explained in the notes on
<i>Lucrece</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> 1127. As a serenade it is named in the <i>Two Gent.</i> III, ii,
83. The nature of the steps of this dance is not certainly known. Two
features, however, may be guessed at&#8212;viz., a tapping of the foot at
certain places, which may be inferred from the possible connection of
the word with 'Thump'; and secondly, an alternation of a slow sliding
step, interspersed with dead pauses, and a quicker movement, succeeded
again by the slow step. These last seem to be indicated by the music
of 'My Lady Carey's Dump,' part of which is given in the
<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>. The
character of the Dump has given us the modern expression of 'in the
dumps'&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, sulky; and this is also used commonly in Shakespeare.</p>

<p>In the next passage, Peter, Capulet's servant, speaks ironically of a
'merry' dump, and quotes verse 1 of Richard Edwards' song, 'When
griping grief.' For an account of that song see <a href="#III">Section III.</a>, about
Songs and Singing. In Peter's quotation, the dumps are 'doleful.'</p>

<p>The quibbles on 'silver sound,' 'sweet sound,' 'sound for silver,' 'no
<i>gold</i> for sounding,' are further examples of Shakespeare's fondness
for joking on musical matters. Peter's reply to the Third Musician,
'You are the singer; I will <i>say</i> for you,' may be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> just reflection
on Mr James Soundpost's lack of words, or perhaps indicates that the
pronunciation of singers even in that musical age was no better than
it is now.</p>

<p>The improvised names of the musicians are pointed enough; Simon
'Catling,' referring to the material of his viol strings; Hugh
'Rebeck,' the rebeck being the ancient English fiddle with three
strings. The 'smal&#233;' Ribible, which Absolon, the parish clerk in
Chaucer, used to play 'song&#233;s' on, is supposed to be the same
instrument; and finally, James 'Soundpost,' which wants no explaining.</p>

<p>The final remark of Musician 2 is delicious, 'tarry for the mourners,
and stay dinner.'</p>

<p>The Hay, Hey, or Raye, seems to be mentioned only once&#8212;viz., in
<i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>, in the account of the preparations for the
Pageant of the Worthies. Constable Dull proposes to accompany the
dancing of the hay with a tabor, which may be taken as the common
practice. Holofernes says Dull's idea is 'most dull,' like himself.
The Hay was a Round country-dance&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, the performers stood in a
circle to begin with, and then (in the words of an old direction
quoted in Stainer and Barrett's Dict.) 'wind round <i>handing</i> in
passing until you come to your places.' See the <a href="#ORCHESOGRAPHIE">note on Arbeau's
Orch&#233;sographie</a> for the steps and tune of the Haye.</p>

<p>Hawkins says (Hist. 705) that in an old comedy called the Rehearsal,
the Earth, the Sun, and Moon are made to dance the Hey to the tune of
Trenchmore, which is referred to in the above-quoted passage from
Selden, as a lively and even boisterous dance.</p>

<p>The Morrice Dance, or Morris, was very popular in England and other
countries in the 16th century.</p>

<p>Relics of it may still be seen in country places at certain times of
the year. The very meagre celebrations of May Day, which can be seen
in London even now, are a survival of the ancient customs with which
the Morrice-Dance was always associated. Hawkins gives this account of
the Morris; &quot;there are few country places in this kingdom where it is
not known; it is a dance of young men in their shirts, with bells at
their feet, and ribbons of various colours tied round their arms, and
slung across their shoulders. Some writers, Shakespeare in particular,
mention a Hobby-horse and a Maid Marian, as necessary in this
recreation. Sir William Temple speaks of a pamphlet in the library of
the Earl of Leicester, which gave an account of a set of
morrice-dancers in King James's reign, composed of ten men or twelve
men, for the ambiguity of his expression renders it impossible to say
which of the two numbers is meant, who went about the country: that
they danced a Maid Marian, with a tabor and pipe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> that their ages
one with another made up twelve hundred years.&quot;</p>

<p>[Temple's own words are quite clear&#8212;viz., that there were <i>ten</i> men
who danced; a Maid Marian (makes eleven); and a man to play the tabor
and pipe (makes twelve).]</p>

<p>The name Morrice means Moorish dance, or Morisco. Perhaps it was
called so from being accompanied by the tabor, for Drums of all sorts
are distinctly Eastern instruments.</p>

<p>Two tunes, one a Moresca by Monteverde, 1608, and the other an English
Morris, 1650, are given in the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>. Also see
<a href="#ORCHESOGRAPHIE">Note on
'Orch&#233;sographie'</a> for a Morisque.</p>

<p>The first of the two following passages connects the morris with May
Day; the second with Whitsuntide, which is in May as often as not.</p>

</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>The Pavan has been mentioned before, as the dance in Duple time which
preceded the Galliard which was in a triple rhythm. It was a stately
dance, with a stately name, for the derivation is most probably from
<i>Pavo</i>, a peacock, with a reference, no doubt, to the majestic strut
and gay feathers of that bird. It was <i>de rigueur</i> for gentlemen to
dance the Pavan in cap and sword; for lawyers to wear their gowns,
princes their mantles; and ladies to take part in the fullest of full
dress, the long trains of their gowns being supposed to correspond in
appearance and movement to the peacock's tail.</p>

<p>The only Pavan mentioned by Shakespeare is the <i>Passy-measures pavin</i>,
otherwise known as Passing-measures-pavin, or Passameso, or <i>Pass e
mezzo</i>, which last is the earliest form of the word.</p>

<p>Praetorius (<i>b.</i> 1571), however, says the Passe mezzo is so called
because it has only <i>half as many steps</i> as a Galliard. Thus the name
is inverted, mezzo Passo. Hawkins helps to confuse the matter by
explaining that the Galliard has <i>five bars or steps</i> in the first
strain, and that the Passamezzo has just half that number, and thus
gets its name. No Galliard ever had an uneven number of bars in any of
its strains, so this account is difficult to reconcile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>However, Pass e mezzo, 'step and a half,' is the most trustworthy form
of the name, and the <a href="#ORCHESOGRAPHIE">Note on the Orch&#233;sographie</a> of Arbeau (1588) makes
all quite clear.</p>

<p>The Passamezzo (or passy-measures pavin) tune in the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a> has a
similar construction to the ordinary pavan, the form of which has been
explained earlier in this section&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, it consists of regular
'strains,' which in their turn contain a certain <i>even</i> number of
semibreves, or 'bars.' In the case given, the strains consist of
<i>eight</i> bars each. This must be borne in mind, in connection with Sir
Toby's drunken fancy about the surgeon, in the following passage:&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Tw.</i> V, i, 197.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Sir To.</i> [Drunk, and with a bloody coxcomb]&#8212;Sot, didst see
Dick surgeon, sot?</p>

<p><i>Clo.</i> O! he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were
<i>set at eight</i> i' the morning.</p>

<p><i>Sir To.</i> Then he's a rogue, and a <i>passy-measures pavin</i>.</p></div>

<p>Toby being only moderately sober, naturally feels indignant at the
doctor's indiscretions in the same kind; and, quite as naturally, the
Clown's remark about the latter's eyes brings this fantastic
comparison into his head. The doctor's eyes were set <i>at eight</i>, and
so is a Pavan set 'at eight.' It is easy to see Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> Toby's musical
gifts asserting themselves, confused recollections reeling across his
brain, of that old rule in Morley about the right number of semibreves
in a strain, 'fewer then <i>eight</i> I have not seen in any <i>Pavan</i>.'
'Also in this you must cast your musicke by <i>foure</i>: ... no matter how
manie <i>foures</i> you put in your straine.' Bull's Pavan, 'St Thomas
Wake,' has two strains of <i>sixteen</i> bars each&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, two 'eights.'
[<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.]</p>

<p>The last passage given here shows clearly that the Lavolta and Coranto
were considered exotic in England in Shakespeare's time.</p>

<p>The French ladies here recommend their runaway husbands and brothers
to cross the Channel and try to earn a living by teaching French
dances to the stately English. Probably the &quot;English dancing-schools&quot;
in those days would think the solemn walk of the Pavan quite as lively
an amusement as good society could allow. There are other passages too
which show that Shakespeare (or his characters) had a fine 'insular'
feeling against these 'newfangled' fashions from France.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap"><a name="ORCHESOGRAPHIE">Note on Arbeau's 'Orch&#233;sographie,' 1588.</a></span></h3>

<p>This interesting book on the Art of Dancing was published at <span title="Transcriber's Note: corrected from Maon">M&#226;con</span>
in 1588. [The date on the
title page is 1589.] The author was Jehan Tabourot, but his real name
does not appear in the work, being anagrammatised into Thoinot Arbeau;
and under the guise of Arbeau he is best known.</p>

<p>The treatise is written (like Morley's Introduction to Practical
Music) in the form of Dialogue between Master (Arbeau) and Pupil
(Capriol); and gives a most clear description of all the fashionable
dances of the time, as far as words can do it; dance tunes in music
type; and incidentally, many instructions as to the manners of good
society.</p>

<p>As much light is thrown upon the dances which are mentioned in
Shakespeare by this book, some of the principal descriptions will be
given here, with the proper music.</p>

<p>On p. 25, Capriol (the Pupil) asks his Master (Arbeau) to describe the
steps of the 'basse' dance. This was the 'danse par bas, ou sans
sauter,' which was of the 15th century, was in triple time, and
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>tained three parts, A, basse dance; B, Retour de la basse dance;
C, Tordion. This 3rd part, or tordion, 'n'est aultre chose qu'une
gaillarde <i>par terre</i>'; <i>i.e.</i>, the Tordion of a Basse dance was
simply a Galliard <i>par terre</i>, without the leaping or 'Sault majeur.'</p>

<p>Before Arbeau answers his pupil, he gives him some preliminary
instruction as to the etiquette of the ball room. He says&#8212;'In the
first place ... you should choose some virtuous damsel whose
appearance pleases you (telle que bon vous semblera), take off your
hat or cap in your left hand, and tender her your right hand to lead
her out to dance. She, being modest and well brought up, will give you
her left hand, and rise to follow you. Then conduct her to the end of
the room, face each the other, and tell the band to play a basse
dance. For if you do not, they may inadvertently play some other kind
of dance. And when they begin to play, you begin to dance.'</p>

<p><i>Capriol.</i> If the lady should refuse, I should feel dreadfully
ashamed.</p>

<p><i>Arbeau.</i> A properly educated young lady <span class="smcap">never</span> refuses one who does
her the honour to lead her out to the dance. If she does, she is
accounted foolish (sotte), for if she doesn't want to dance, what is
she sitting there for amongst the rest?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>The Master then gives his pupil an account of the basse dance, the 1st
and 2nd parts of which are composed of various arrangements of the
following movements&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. La r&#233;v&#233;rence, marked with a big R.</p>

<p>2. Le branle (<i>not</i> the dance of that name), marked with b.</p>

<p>3. Deux simples, marked ss.</p>

<p>4. Le double, marked d.</p>

<p>5. La reprise, marked with a little r.</p></div>

<p>The 'chanson'&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, the dance tune, was played on the flute, and
accompanied by the 'tabourin' or drum, which beats all the time. Every
'bar' of the music is called either a 'battement' of the drum, or a
'mesure' of the chanson.</p>

<p>Now Arbeau explains the steps and time of each of the above five
movements.</p>

<p>1. R. This takes four bars. Begin with left foot forward, and in doing
the r&#233;v&#233;rence, half turn your body and face towards the Damoiselle,
and cast on her 'un gracieux regard.'</p>

<p>2. b.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Also takes four bars. Keep the feet joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> together, then
for the 1st bar, swing the body gently to the left side; 2nd bar,
swing to the right, while gazing modestly upon 'les assistants;' 3rd
bar, swing again to the left; and for the 4th bar, swing to the right
side, looking on the Damoiselle with an 'oeillade defrob&#233;e, doulcement
et discretement.'</p>

<p>3. ss. 1st bar, left foot forward; 2nd bar, bring right foot up to the
said left foot; 3rd bar, advance the right foot; 4th bar, join the
left foot to the said right foot; et ainsi sera parfaict le mouvement
des deux simples.</p>

<p>N.B.&#8212;Always suit the length of your steps to the size of the room,
and the convenience of the Damoiselle, who cannot with modesty take
such big steps as you can.</p>

<p>4. d. 1st bar, advance left foot; and, advance right foot; 3rd,
advance left foot; 4th, join right to left. For <i>two</i> doubles (dd) do
it over again, but contrariwise, beginning with the Right foot. For
<i>three</i> doubles (ddd), the form of the third will be, 1st bar, advance
left foot; 2nd, advance right foot; 3rd, advance left foot; 4th, 'puis
tumber&#224; pieds joincts comme a est&#232; faict au premier double.' And thus
(he carefully adds) the three doubles are achieved in 12 'battements
et mesures du tabourin.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The Reprise (r) is commonly found before the branle (b), and
sometimes before the double (d) [see the Memoires]. In it you have to
cultivate a certain movement of the knees, or feet, or 'les artoils
seullement,' as if your feet were shaking under you. 1st bar, 'les
artoils' of the right foot; 2nd bar, do.; 3rd bar, of the left foot;
4th, of the right foot again.</p>

<p>The <i>Memoire</i> of the movements of the basse dance&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, its first
Part, is&#8212;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">R b ss d r | d r b ss ddd r d r b | ss d r b C.</p>

<p>The C means the 'cong&#233;,' or 'leave' which you must take of the
Damoiselle, salute her, and keep hold of her hand, and lead her back
to where you began, in order to dance the Second Part&#8212;namely, the
Retour de la basse dance, the <i>Memoire</i> for which is&#8212;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">b | d r b ss ddd r d r b | C.</p>

<p>[The nine movements enclosed between the upright lines, are the same
in both parts].</p>

<p>Capriol now remarks that he has been counting up, and finds that the
music of the <i>basse dance</i> proper (part 1) has 20 'fours' (vingt
quaternions), and the <i>retour</i> (part 2) has 12 'fours.'</p>

<p>Arbeau then describes the Tordion, which is Part 3 of the basse dance.
He says it is still in triple time, but 'plus legiere et concit&#233;e,'
and does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> consist of 'simples, doubles, reprises,' etc., like the
first and second parts, but is danced almost exactly as a Galliard,
except that it is <i>par terre</i>&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, without any capers, and low on
the ground, with a quick and light step; whereas the Galliard is
danced <i>high</i>, with a slower and weightier 'mesure.'</p>

<p>He gives the following tune, which will fit to <i>any</i> of the
innumerable diversities of Galliard. If played fast, it is a Tordion,
if slower, a Galliard. [There are, of course, no bars in the
original.]</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b><span class="smcap">Tordion or Galliard (Cinquepace).</span></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center">

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="music/music01.mid">Listen</a></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Here are the Steps of the Galliard, consisting of five movements of
the feet, and the caper, or 'sault majeur.' The five steps give the
Galliard the name of Cinque pas.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
1. Greve gaulche. ['Greve' is explained as a 'coup de pied.']<br />
<br />

<br />
5. Sault majeur.<br />
<br />
6. Posture gaulche.<br />
</p></div>

<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are the 'Cinq' pas, and 5 is the characteristic leap or
caper.</p>

<p>The next six minims are danced to the Revers, which is just the same,
except that the words 'right' and 'left' (<i>droicte</i> and <i>gaulche</i>)
change places all the way down. Then repeat till the tune is finished.</p>

<p>Arbeau gives several other varieties of Galliard, and another very
good tune for it, called</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b><span class="smcap">'Anthoinette.' Galliard.</span></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/music02.png" width="700" height="163" alt="music" title="music" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">[<a href="music/music02.mid">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>The 'sault majeur' in this tune would come in the middle of the
semibreves in the first strain; at the 'dot' of the dotted minims in
the 2nd and 3rd strains; or, again, in the middle of the semibreves in
the same strains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the Pavan [commonly danced before the Basse-dance], Arbeau says it
is very easy, consisting only of 'two simples and a double' advancing,
and again 'two simples and a double' retiring. It is (as we already
know) in Binary measure, and the careful Capriol once more joins in
with his calculations of time, saying that he makes the Pavan 8
measures [semibreves] 'en marchant,' and 8 measures 'desmarchant.'</p>

<p>The master now gives particular instructions about the form and manner
of dancing the Pavan. Noblemen dance these pavans and basse-dances
'belles et graves,' with cap and sword; others in long robes,
'marchants honnestement, avec une gravit&#233; pos&#233;e.' And the damoiselles
with an humble countenance, 'les yeulx baissez, regardans quelquefois
les assistans avec une pudeur virginale.' Kings, princes, and
'Seigneurs graves,' in dancing the pavan on great occasions, wear
their 'grands manteaux, et robes de parade.' Also, Queens, Princesses,
and Ladies accompanying them, have their robes 'abaiss&#233;es et
trainans,' 'quelquefois port&#233;es par demoiselles.' The Pavan on these
occasions is called <span class="smcap">Le Grand Bal</span>, and the music is provided, not by
simple flute and drum, but by 'haulbois et saquebouttes,' and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
continue the tune until the dancers have made the circuit of the
'salle' twice or thrice.</p>

<p>Besides this state dancing of pavans, this dance was used in
Mascarade, when triumphal chariots of gods and goddesses enter, or of
emperors and kings 'plains de maiest&#233;.'</p>

<p>On p. 29 ff, Arbeau gives the vocal Pavan for four voices, 'Belle qui
tiens ma vie,' which is quoted in Grove. The proper drum
accompaniment, continued throughout the 32 bars (2/2) is&#8212;<img src="images/notes.jpg" width="162" height="26" alt="music notes" title="music notes" /> etc.
He also gives seven more verses of words to it, and says if you do not
wish to dance, you can play or sing it. Moreover, he adds, that the
drum is not a necessity, but is good to keep the time equal; and that
for dancing you may use violins, spinets, flutes, both traverse and '&#224;
neuf trous' (nine-holed flute&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, a flageolet), hautboys, and, in
fact, 'all sorts of instruments'; or you may sing instead.</p>

<p>Arbeau's account of the Passemeze, or Passy-measures-pavin of
Shakespeare, is very simple. He says that the instrumentalists
increase the speed of the <i>pavan</i> every time they play it through, and
by the time it has reached the moderate speed of a <i>basse-dance</i>, it
is no longer called Pavan, but Passemeze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the State Pavan, and the Passamezzo Pavan, there is the
'Pavane d'Espagne,' which has some similarity to the Canaries.</p>

<p>Arbeau says that some consider the name Canaries to be that of a dance
in use in those islands. But he thinks it more likely to have
originated in a Ballet in a Mascarade, where the dancers were clad as
kings and queens 'de Mauritanie,' as savages, with various coloured
feathers. He says it is danced by a gentleman and a lady, from
opposite ends of the room, each advancing and then retiring in turn.</p>

<p>The steps and tune are as follows&#8212;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b><span class="smcap">Canaries.</span></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/music03.png" width="700" height="194" alt="music" title="music" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">[<a href="music/music03.mid">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Tappement du pied gauche, causant pied en l'air droit.</p>

<p>2. Marque talon droit (right heel).</p>

<p>3. Marque pied droit.</p>

<p>4. Tappement du pied droit, causant pied en l'air gauche.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Marque talon gauche (left heel).</p>

<p>6. Marque pied gauche.</p>

<p>7-12 are the same again.</p></div>

<p>Then for the 2nd half, instead of the 'tappements' at the minims, you
should make 'une greve fort haulte, rabaiss&#233;e en tappement de pied
train&#233; en derrier, comme si on marchoit dessus un crachat, ou qu'on
voulust tuer une araign&#233;e.' (Make a very high step, but instead of
tapping the foot, scrape it backwards, as if you were treading on
spittle, or wanted to kill a spider.)</p>

<p>Arbeau gives 17 different kinds of Branle (Brawl of Shakespeare)
before coming to the Branle des Sabots, which is danced, 2 beats in a
bar, four steps to the right, then four to the left, like the branle
doubles; then two simples (see above), and three taps of the foot, and
Repeat.</p>

<p>There is only one step to each Semibreve, so the tune must have been
played fast.</p>

<p>On p. 64 Arbeau treats of the Lavolta ('high lavolt' of Shakespeare),
which he says is a kind of galliard well known in Provence. One
feature was that you had to keep turning round.</p>

<p><i>Capriol</i> does not agree with these whirlings, for he immediately
says&#8212;'Ces vertigues et tornoiements de cerveau me fascheroient.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>1, 2, simple gauche; 3, 4, simple droit; and 5-8, a 'double &#224; gauche.'
These terms have already been explained.</p>

<p>One of the many Bransles is the 'Branle de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> Haye,' the Hay of
Shakespeare. Arbeau says&#8212;first the dancers dance alone, each
separately; then together <i>so as to interlace</i>, 'et font <i>la haye</i> les
uns parmy les aultres.' That is, during each batch of 4 steps, the
dancers <i>change places</i> one with another, so that if there are three
dancers, A, B, C, in the first 4 steps, B and A change places, and
make B, A, C; in the next 4 steps, C and A change places, and make B,
C, A, etc.</p>

<p>The Morisque, which may at all events be compared with the little we
know of the Shakespearian Morris dance, seems to have been very
violent exercise for the heels (talon). Arbeau mentions that it is bad
for the gout. The reader will notice that there is a separate movement
for each crotchet in the following tune.</p>

concerned, is that which treats of the Music of the Spheres. Besides
the two passages here quoted, there are others dealing with this
subject&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>,</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> V, ii, 84, 'the tun&#232;d spheres'; <i>Twelf.</i> III, i, 115, 'music
from the spheres'; <i>Per.</i> V, i, 226, 'The music of the spheres.'</p>

<p>'This, Pythagoras, first of all the Greeks [560 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>] conceived in his
mind; and understood that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> the spheres sounded something concordant,
because of the necessity of proportion, which never forsakes celestial
beings.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>'Pythagoras, by musical proportion, calleth that a tone, by how much
the moon is distant from the earth: from the moon to Mercury the half
of that space, and from Mercury to Venus almost as much; from Venus to
the Sun, sesquiple [<i>i.e.</i>, half as much more as a tone]; from the Sun
to Mars, a tone, that is as far as the moon is from the earth: from
Mars to Jupiter, half, and from Jupiter to Saturn, half, and thence to
the zodiac, sesquiple.'</p>

<p>'Thus there are made <i>seven tones</i>, which they call a <i>diapason</i>
harmony, that is, an <i>universal concent</i>, in which Saturn moves in the
Doric mood, Jupiter in the Phrygian, and in the rest the like.'</p>

<p>'Those sounds which the seven planets, and the sphere of fixed stars,
and that which is above us, termed by them Antichton [opposite the
earth], make, Pythagoras affirmed to be the Nine Muses; but the
composition and symphony ... he named Mnemosyne [Memory, the Mother of
the Muses].'</p>

<p>Censorinus, a Roman Grammarian, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 238, in his book De Die Natali,
says&#8212;</p>

<p>'To these things we may add what Pythagoras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> taught, namely, that the
whole world was constructed according to musical ratio, and that the
seven planets ... have a rhythmical motion and distances adapted to
musical intervals, and emit sounds, every one different in proportion
to its height [Saturn was said to be the highest, as it is the
farthest away, and was supposed to give the gravest note of the
heavenly Diapason, which note was therefore called Hypate, or
'highest'], which sounds are so concordant as to produce a most sweet
melody, though <i>inaudible to us by reason of the greatness of the
sounds</i>, which the narrow passages of our ears are not capable of
admitting.'</p>

<p>These extracts fairly represent the ancient opinion about the Music of
the spheres. There was a strong tendency last century to revive the
notion, and even to our modern ideas, with our Copernican astronomy,
there remains at least the possibility of drawing fantastical
analogies between the proportionate distances of the planets and the
proportionate vibration numbers of the partial tones in a musically
vibrating string or pipe.</p>

<p>The idea of the musical Chorus or dance of the heavenly bodies was
perfectly familiar to all writers in the 16th and 17th centuries. An
excellent example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> is in Paradise Lost, Book V., in the twelve lines
beginning 'So spake the Omnipotent.' Even finer is the 13th verse of
the Nativity Hymn.</p>

<p>No one could help thinking of the text in Job xxxviii. 7, 'When the
morning stars sang together,' in this connection, and Milton naturally
refers to it in the previous verse.</p>

<p>Here follow the two Shakespeare extracts. The second one is full of
beauty of every kind, but the Pythagoreanism is in the last six lines,
with Shakespeare's own view about <i>why</i> we cannot hear the heavenly
music.</p>

<p>This is finer than Pythagoras.</p>

<p>The next three passages are concerned with the 'fantasie' of Music.
Jaques gives an opinion in a general form&#8212;viz., that the musician's
'melancholy' is 'fantastical'; Mariana and the Duke speak of a certain
<i>doubleness</i> that may be noticed in the action of music on the mind.
Jessica is 'never merry' when she hears sweet music: Lorenzo descants
on the evident effects of music on even hardened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> natures; while
Portia and Nerissa preach a neat little sermon on the text 'Nothing is
good without respect,' with musical illustrations of the powerful
influence of time and place&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, the silence of night, makes the
music sound sweeter than by day; the crow sings as well as the lark,
if the circumstances favour the crow, or if the lark is not present to
give immediate comparison; and even the nightingale's song is no
better than the wren's, 'by day, when every goose is cackling.'</p>

</p></div>

<p>Here is an example of a superstitious meaning attaching to supposed
mysterious music.</p>

<p>There are very few cases of this kind in Shakespeare&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, where
the music of the stage is an integral part of the drama.</p>

<p><i>Antony and Cleop.</i> IV, iii, 12. Music of hautboys under the stage.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>4 Soldier.</i> ... Peace, what noise?<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>1 Sold.</i><span style="margin-left: 12em;">Peace, I say!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">What should this mean?</span><br />
<br />
<i>2 Sold.</i> 'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Now leaves him.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>A very usual popular amusement was the Masque, which would consist of
a public procession with decorated cars containing the characters,
accompanied by hobby horses, tumblers, and open air music. This is
referred to in the next passage, where Theseus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> speaks of the masque
as an 'abridgement' for the evening, that is, an entertainment to
shorten the hours. The lamentable play of Pyramus and Thisbe follows,
which, it will be noticed, has some of the main features of a masque.</p>

<p><i>Mid's Night's Dream</i> V, i, 39.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Theseus.</i> Say, what abridgment have you for this evening?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>What masque, what music?</i>...</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">* * * * *</span>
</p>

<p>[Reads from the paper]</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Merry and tragical! Tedious and brief!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That is, hot ice, and wonderous strange snow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">How shall we find the <i>concord of this discord</i>?</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>In the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, Shylock mentions the procession of a
masque through the streets, forbidding Jessica to look out of the
window at these 'Christian fools with varnished faces.' The music
accompanying the procession is named&#8212;viz., drum and fife.</p>

<p><i>Merchant</i> II, v, 22.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Lancelot.</i> 'You shall see a <i>masque</i>' ...<br />
<br />
<i>Shylock.</i> What! are there <i>masques</i>?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Hear you me, Jessica.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Lock up my doors; and <i>when you hear the drum</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the <i>vile squeaking of the wryneck'd fife</i>,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Clamber not you up to the casements then,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Nor thrust your head into the public street</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To gaze on <i>Christian fools with varnish'd faces</i>.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The 'vile squeaking of the wryneck'd fife' is of some musical
interest. The adjective 'wryneck'd' refers, not to the instrument
itself, which was straight, but to the player, whose head has to be
slightly twisted round to get at the mouthpiece. Mersennus (b. 1588)
says that the Fife is the same as the Tibia Helvetica, which was
simply a small edition of the Flauto Traverso, or German Flute. That
is, the Fife of those days was much the same as the modern Fife of the
cheaper kind, with the usual six holes, and a big hole near the
stopped end, where the breath was applied. The instrument was
therefore held <i>across</i> [traverso] the face of the player, whose head
would be turned sideways, and hence comes Shylock's description of it
as the 'wryneck'd' fife.</p>

<p>In <i>Much Ado</i>, Benedick draws a distinction between the Drum and Fife
and the Tabor and Pipe. The former (see <i>Othello</i> III. iii. 353) were
of a decided military cast; whereas the latter were more associated
with May Day entertainments, bull-baitings, and out-of-door amusements
generally. The Tabor was a little drum, the Pipe (as explained before,
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<a href="#III">Section III.</a>, about Autolycus) a tiny whistle with only three
holes. The two were played simultaneously by one person.</p>

<p><i>Much Ado</i> II, iii, 13. Benedick, of Claudio in love.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Ben.</i> I have known, when there was no <i>music</i> with him but
the <i>drum and the fife</i>; and now had he rather hear the
<i>tabor and the pipe</i>: ... but till all graces be in one
woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall
be, that's certain; wise, or I'll none; ... of good
discourse, an <i>excellent musician</i>, and her hair shall be of
what colour it please God.</p></div>

<p>Besides these more civilised 'pipes,' the country-man's pipe of
cornstalk is mentioned by Titania, in <i>Mids.</i> II. ii. 8. This was
really a 'reed,' not a whistle of any kind.</p>

<p>The tabor leads one on to the Tabourine, which was the full-sized
military drum, corresponding to the modern side-drum. See <i>Troil.</i> IV,
v, 275. 'Beat loud the tabourines,' and <i>Antony</i> IV, viii, 37, 'our
rattling tabourines.'</p>

<p>The drum supplied the great proportion of military music in those
days, besides having its importance as a means of signalling orders to
the troops. This is dealt with more fully in the chapter on Stage
Directions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>Parolles' sham anxiety about a lost drum is mentioned fourteen or
fifteen times in <i>All's Well</i> III. v. and vi.; and IV. i. Parolles
earns his nickname of 'Tom Drum,' in Act V. iii. 320.</p>

<p>The following is an interesting passage of a more serious kind&#8212;</p>

<p><i>K. John</i> V, ii, 164.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Lewis</i> [Dauphin.]<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Strike up the <i>drums</i>! and let the tongue of war</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Plead for our interest, and our being here.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Bastard.</i> Indeed, your <i>drums</i>, being <i>beaten</i>, will cry out;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And so shall you, being <i>beaten</i>. Do but start</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An <i>echo</i> with the clamour of thy drum,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And even at hand a <i>drum</i> is ready brac'd,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Sound</i> but <i>another</i>, and another shall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As loud as thine, <i>rattle the welkin's ear</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>An entirely different use of the Drum is alluded to by Parolles, in
his slanderous evidence against Captain Dumain.</p>

<p><i>All's Well</i> IV, iii, 262.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1 Soldier.</i> What say you to his expertness in war?</p>

<p><i>Parolles.</i> 'Faith, sir, he has <i>led the drum before the

not.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>There are several occasions in Shakespeare when <i>trumpets</i> are sounded
to herald the approach of play-actors, but <i>drums</i> are not mentioned
in this connection except here. Rimbault's Preface to Purcell's Opera
'Bonduca' (Musical Antiquarian Society) says that a Play was always
introduced by the trumpet sounding three times, after which the
Prologue entered. Dekker, referring to the list of <i>errata</i> in his
'Satiromastix,' 1602, says&#8212;&quot;Instead of the trumpets sounding thrice
before the play begin, it shall not be amiss for him that will read,
first to behold this short Comedy of Errors.&quot;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>


<p><i><span class="smcap">Alarum</span>, Alarums</i> (of Drums), occurs as a stage direction about 72
times in fourteen of the historical plays, always in connection with
battle. It is found alone, as above, about 45 times, sometimes
qualified&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, Loud alarum, Low alarum, Short alarum, Alarum
within. <i>Alarums and Excursions</i> occurs about 21 times, always in
fight. ['Excursions' merely means 'parties of men running about;' see
the stage direction <i>H. 6. A.</i> IV, vi. 'Excursions, <i>wherein</i> Talbot's
son is hemmed about;' also <i>Id.</i> I, v, where the direction has
'Alarum. <i>Skirmishings</i>,' instead of the usual 'excursions.']</p>

<p>A few special cases are&#8212;Alarum <i>with thunder and lightning</i>, <i>H. 6.
A.</i> I, iv, 97; <i>Flourish and Alarums</i>, used by Rich. III. to drown the
reproaches of Q. Eliz., etc.; Alarum and <i>chambers</i> [cannon] <i>go off</i>,
<i>H. 5.</i> Act iii. line 33 of the chorus, and again <i>Id.</i> end of scene
1;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> Alarum <i>and cry within</i>, 'Fly, fly, fly,' <i>Jul. C&#230;s.</i> V, v; Alarum
afar off, <i>as at a sea fight</i>, <i>Ant.</i> IV, x.</p>

<p>Out of the 72 cases in the stage directions, 70 mean a call to battle
by <i>drums</i>. There are only two exceptions, where the Alarum is
identified with trumpets, <i>H. 6. B.</i> II, iii, 92, and <i>Troil.</i> IV, v,
112, 117.</p>

<p>Skeat gives the original of the term as 'all'arme' (Ital.) a war cry
of the time of the Crusades. For the <i>form</i> of the word, he compares
<i>arum</i> (arm) and <i>koren</i> (corn).</p>

<p><i>'Alarum' in the text.</i></p>

<p>The word is used 13 times in the text of Shakespeare; and in 6 of
these it refers to <i>drums</i>, as in the stage directions <i>H. 6. A.</i> I,
ii, 18, I, iv, 99, II, i, 42; <i>R. 3.</i> I, i, 7; <i>Cor.</i> II, ii, 76; <i>H.
5.</i> IV, vi, 35.</p>

<p>But in two of the remaining examples, alarum is distinctly said to be
<i>trumpets</i>, <i>H. 6. B.</i> II, iii, 93 and V, ii, 3; while other more
extended meanings are found&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, in <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, l. 700,
where it refers to the noise of the dogs hunting the hare; in
<i>Macbeth</i> II, iii, 75 and V, v, 51, where alarum is used of a Bell;
also in <i>Lucrece</i>, 433, of Tarquin's 'drumming heart' 'giving the hot
charge,' and <i>Othello</i> II, iii, 27, of Desdemona's voice, which Iago
says is 'an alarum to love.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p><i><a name="Flourish">Flourish</a></i>, either simply in this form, or 'Flourish of Trumpets' (six
times) or 'Flourish of Cornets' (twice), occurs about 68 times in
seventeen plays.</p>

<p>Out of these, it is used some 22 times for the entrance or exit of a
King or Queen; 12 times for the entrance or exit of a distinguished
person not a king; 10 times in the public welcome of a Queen or great
general; 7 times it marks the end of a scene; 6 times heralds a
victorious force; twice announces the proclamation of a King; twice
signalises the entrance or exit of Senate or Tribunes; and twice gives
warning of the approach of Play-actors [See <a href="#IV">Section VI.</a>, at end], or
the commencement of a Play. [Players in Hamlet, and Pyramus and Thisbe
in <i>Mids. Nt.</i>].</p>

<p>Some solitary uses are where Rich. III. orders a Flourish to drown the
reproaches of Qu. Eliz. and the Duchess of York; the occasion of the
betrothal of H. V. and Katherine of France; and the public welcome of
the three Ladies in Coriolanus. The last is <i>A Flourish with drums and
trumpets</i>, which occurs several times. In Grove's Dictionary (under
'Fanfare') is given a seven bar Flourish which is believed to be of
Charles II.'s time, and is still used at the opening of Parliament.
[<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>'Flourish' in the text is only found twice. In <i>Richard III.</i> IV, iv,
149, 'A flourish, trumpets!&#8212;strike alarum, drums!' we have a clear
definition of the two terms mentioned; and in <i>Merchant</i> III, ii, 49,
'even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a new-crowned
monarch;' a reference to the principal use of the Flourish, which was
to signify the presence of Royal persons.</p>

<p><i>Trumpets</i>, <i>A trumpet sounds</i>, <i>Trumpet sounded within</i>, <i>Drums and
trumpets</i>, <i>Flourish of Trumpets</i> (6 times).</p>

<p>One or other of the above occurs some 51 times in twenty-two plays,
either alone, or in connection with Sennet, discharge of cannon, etc.
On 18 of these occasions it announces the entrance or presence of a
King or Royal personage; 13 times it figures as part of the
proceedings in Duels; 10 times signifies the entrance or exit of
principal persons, not royal, great generals, etc.; 3 times precedes a
public procession, with Royal persons in it; twice it is connected
with the advent of Royal Heralds; and once with the arrival of Players
(<i>Shrew</i>, Prologue. See also <a href="#Flourish">Flourish</a>).</p>

<p>Thus 'Trumpets' divides the honours with 'Flourish' as the mark of
Royalty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Examples of the use of the term in the text are numerous, and are
found in most of the plays. They are not generally of very special
interest.</p>

<p><i>Music, Music plays, Music within.</i></p>

<p>This direction is found 41 times in twenty-two plays, half of which
are comedies.</p>

<p>In 8 cases we have <i>Music</i> during a speech or dream of one of the
characters; 7 times as the symphony or the accompaniment to a Song; 7
times in Wedding processions or Pageants; 6 times for Dancing; and 5
times during a banquet.</p>

<p>To give a just idea of the amount of Stage Music considered necessary
in or near Shakespeare's time, there must be added to the above, all
the stage directions in other terms&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Hautboys</i>, which is
found about 14 times.</p>

<p>Here are a few relics of Stage Music before Shakespeare's day.</p>

<p>The playing of the minstrels is frequently mentioned in the old
Miracle Plays, and the instruments used were the horn, pipe, tabret,
and flute. In the Prologue to the Miracle Play, Childermas Day, 1512,
the minstrels are requested to 'do their diligence,' and at the end of
the Play to 'geve us a daunce.'</p>

<p>In Richard Edwards's <i>Damon and <span title="Transcriber's Note: 'Pithias' is correct for the title of this play">Pithias</span></i>,
acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> in 1565,
there is a stage direction. &quot;Here Pythias sings and the regalles
play.&quot; Also, when Pythias is carried to prison, &quot;the regalls play a
mourning song.&quot; Thus the Regal, a tiny organ that could be easily
carried about, was considered a proper instrument for the stage. In
the old Comedy, Gammer Gurton's Needle, 1566, mention is made by one
of the characters of the music between the acts&#8212;</p>

<p>In Gascoyne's <i>Jocasta</i>, 1566, each act is preceded by a dumb show,
accompanied by &quot;viols, cythren, bandores, flutes, cornets, trumpets,
drums, fifes, and still-pipes.&quot; In Anthony Munday's comedy <i>The Two
Italian Gentlemen</i> (about 1584), the different kinds of music to be
played after each act are mentioned&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, 'a pleasant galliard,' 'a
solemn dump,' or 'a pleasant Allemayne.' A little later, Marston, in
his <i>Sophonisba</i>, 1606, goes into considerable detail as to the music
between the Acts; after Act I., 'the cornets and organs playing loud
full music'; after Act II., 'organs mixed with recorders'; after Act
III., 'organs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> viols, and voices'; after Act IV., 'a base lute and a
treble viol'; and in the course of Act V., 'infernall music plays
softly.' Fiddles, flutes, and hautboys are mentioned by other
dramatists as instruments in use at the theatre at this time.</p>

<p>Rimbault's Introduction to Purcell's opera 'Bonduca' gives the names
of twenty-six Masques and Plays produced between 1586 and 1642 (when
the theatres were closed), all of which contained important music.
Amongst them are Jane Shore, by Henry Lacy, 1586, with music by
William Byrd; seven masques by Ben Jonson, dating 1600-1621, four of
which had music by Ferrabosco; a masque by Beaumont (1612) with music
by Coperario; a play Valentinian, by Beaumont and Fletcher (1617) set
by Robt. Johnson; The Triumphs of Peace by Shirley (1633), with music
by William Lawes and Simon Ives; several other masques, set by Henry
Lawes, who did the music to Milton's <i>Comus</i> (1634), etc. The list
also includes Shakespeare's <i>Tempest</i>, with Robt. Johnson's music, two
numbers of which, viz., 'Full fathom five,' and 'Where the bee sucks,'
are printed in Bridge's Shakespeare's Songs, with date 1612.</p>

<p><i>Retreat</i>, or <i>A Retreat sounded</i>, generally with Alarum, or
Excursions, or with both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Retreat</i> by itself occurs only three times, but in company with
Alarums and [or] Excursions may be found in 16 other places. The whole
19 cases occur in eleven plays.</p>

<p>The word explains itself. The actual notes of a Retreat of
Shakespeare's time are not known.</p>

<p>In the text it has the same meaning.</p>

<p><i>H. 6. A.</i> II, ii, 3. 'Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.'</p>

<p><i>H. 6. B.</i> IV, viii, 4. 'Dare any be so bold to sound retreat or
parley, when I command them kill'?</p>

<p><i>H. 4. A.</i> V, iv, 159. 'The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.'</p>

<p><i>H. 5.</i> III, ii, 89. <i>Macmorris</i>, 'the work ish give over, the trumpet
sound the retreat.'</p>

<p><i>March, Dead March.</i></p>

<p>There are 18 marches provided for altogether; 4 are Dead Marches; 3
National&#8212;viz., English, French, and Danish; and 11 ordinary military
marches.</p>

<p>Probably all are identified with <i>Drums</i>, without any other
instruments. For the three national marches, see
<span title="Transcriber's Note: Added missing scene number"><i>H. 6. A.</i> III, iii, 30 and 33</span>, and <i>Hamlet</i> III, ii, 91.</p>

<p>Hawkins gives (Hist., p. 229) the text of a Royal Warrant of Charles
I., ordering the revival of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> ancient 'march of this our English
nation, so famous in all the honourable achievements and glorious wars
of this our kingdome in forraigne parts [being by the approbation of
strangers themselves confest and acknowledged the best of all
marches].' The warrant goes on to say that this ancient war march of
England 'was, through the negligence and carelessness of drummers, and
by long discontinuance, so altered and changed from the ancient
gravitie and majestie thereof, as it was in danger utterly to have
bene lost and forgotten.' It appears that 'our late deare brother
prince Henry' had taken steps to have the old march restored, at
Greenwich, in 1610; 'In confirmation whereof' the warrant orders all
English or Welsh drummers to 'observe the same,' whether at home or
abroad, 'without any addition or alteration whatever.' 'Given at our
palace of Westminster, the seventh day of February, in the seventh
yeare of our raigne, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland.'</p>

<p>Then follows the march, expressed both in musical notes and
onomatopoetic words. It consists of a Voluntary, and then seven lines
of 'The March,' each of which ends with a 'pause.' The first line is
given thus&#8212;</p>

<p>See the <a href="#APPENDIX">appendix</a> for the translation into musical notes, which is
given in the warrant itself, but the accuracy of which is
questionable.</p>

<p>It seems pretty clear that this ancient march of England is of a
period long anterior to the warrant of Charles I. Several passages of
that document point to this. At any rate, it was so old as to have
almost dropped out of knowledge in 1610.</p>

<p>Hawkins gives an interesting note, in which he mentions that the
characteristic of the old English march of the foot was 'dignity and
gravity,' in which it differed greatly from that of the French, which
is given by Mersennus (<i>b.</i> 1588) as 'brisk and alert.'</p>

<p>There is a curious story of a conversation between Marshal Biron, a
French general, and Sir Roger Williams, a gallant Low-country soldier
of Elizabeth's time. The marshal observed that the English march
<i>being beaten by the drum</i>, was slow, heavy, and sluggish. 'That may
be true,' answered Sir Roger, 'but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> slow as it is, it has traversed
your master's country from one end to the other.'</p>

<p>The references in Shakespeare all go to confirm the opinion that the
March was played by drums alone&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>H. 6. C.</i> I, ii, 69, where
the stage direction is <i>A march afar off</i>, which is immediately
followed by 'I hear their <i>drums</i>.' Again, in the same play, Act IV.,
sc. vii. line 50, '<i>Drummer</i>, strike up, and let us <i>march</i> away. [<i>A
march begun.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Hautboys.</i> This is an important musical term, and occurs about
fourteen times in eight plays. It always implies a certain special
importance in the music, and is generally connected with a Royal
banquet, masque, or procession. In six cases, at least, the direction
has some special qualification&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, Hautboys playing <i>loud</i> music;
<i>A lofty strain or two</i> to the hautboys; Trumpets and hautboys
sounded, and drums beaten <i>all together</i>. In <i>Ant.</i> IV, iii, 12,
Hautboys supply the supposed ominous 'music in the air.'</p>

<p>The term is closely connected with 'Music,' the remarks on which apply
equally to the present case. (See above, on 'Music,' and the music of
16th century plays).</p>

<p>Not long after Shakespeare's time, orchestral music for the theatre
consisted of stringed instruments only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> (<i>i.e.</i>, the violin family,
violins, violas, violoncellos, and the sole surviving 'viol,' the
double-bass) with harpsichord, for general use; while in the more
important pieces, hautboys, and sometimes flutes as well, were added,
playing, as a rule, with the 1st and 2nd violin parts. This, at any
rate, is the case in Purcell's operas. (Purcell died 1695). Thus the
word Hautboys represented very nearly the climax of power to 17th
century ears. Anything beyond this was supplied by the addition of
trumpets, though this was rare; while Drums were very occasionally
used.</p>

<p>The stage direction in Shakespeare may be taken to mean&#8212;'Let the
hautboys be added to the usual band of strings.' In the last of the
above examples, <i>Coriol.</i> V, iv, 50, we have the extreme limit of
power of this time provided for&#8212;viz., trumpets <i>and</i> hautboys <i>and</i>
drums, <i>all together</i>. It is interesting to notice the wording of
Menenius's description of this stage music. 'The trumpets, sackbuts,
psalteries, and fifes, Tabors and cymbals.' The 'sackbut' was merely
our modern slide trombone, while the rest of these instruments were in
common use in the 16th century, except the Psaltery, which Kircher (b.
1601) says is the same as the Nebel of the Bible. The picture he gives
is remarkably like the dulcimers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> which may be seen and heard outside
public-houses to this very day, <i>i.e.</i>, a small hollow chest, with the
strings stretched across it. An instrument of this kind could be
played with the fingers, like a harp, or with a plectrum, like a
zither, or with two little knob-sticks, like the dulcimer. Mersennus
(b. 1588) also identifies the Psaltery with the Dulcimer.</p>

<p>In the text, the Hautboy is only named once, in <i>H. 4. B</i> III, ii,
332, near the end of Falstaff's soliloquy, on old men and lying, where
he says that Shallow was such a withered little wretch that <i>the case
of a treble hautboy</i> was a mansion for him, a court.</p>

<p>The 'treble' hautboy corresponds with our modern instrument, and was
the smallest in size of the hautboy tribe, of which only two now
survive&#8212;viz., the Oboe proper, and its cousin, which is a fifth lower
in pitch, and correspondingly larger, and which has curiously picked
up the name of Corno Inglese, Cor Anglais, or English Horn. None the
less it is the Alto Hautboy. The tenor and bass of the family have not
survived. Hautboys in four parts were the backbone of the French
regimental bands in Lully's time&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, about 1670. [<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.]</p>

<p>The spelling of the word in the old editions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> Shakespeare is
'hoeboy,' which is very like the modern German Hoboe.</p>

<p><i>Sennet.</i> This is a rare direction, and is found only nine times in
eight plays, as against sixty-eight 'Flourishes' and fifty-one
'Trumpets.' The notes of a sennet are unknown. Three times it marks
the entrance or exit of a Parliament, three times is used in a Royal
or quasi-royal procession, and the remaining cases are royal, or near
it.</p>

<p>In the 1st Folio of Hen. V., the word is spelt <i>senet</i>, but in later
ones, <i>Sonet</i>, as if the former were a misprint. In Marlowe's Faustus
(published 1604), Act iii. sc. i., we find '<i>sound a sonnet</i>' [enter
Pope, Cardinal, etc.]. Also the French Cavalry of 1636 used trumpet
calls named <i>Sonneries</i>. These seem to point to a derivation of the
word from <i>sonare</i>, and thus the spelling ought to be <i>sonnet</i>, not
<i>sennet</i>.</p>

<p>But other forms are found&#8212;Synnet, Signet, Signate, which may be
proper derivatives of <i>signum</i>, and thus make this trumpet call 'a
signal,' instead of 'a sounding'; or (which is as likely) may be
corruptions, perhaps of the somewhat featureless form 'Synnet,' caused
by a misunderstanding of the original misspelling 'senet.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>In the text of Shakespeare the word does not occur.</p>

<p><i>Cornets</i>, or <i>Flourish Cornets</i> (only twice).</p>

<p>This is also rare, occurring only eight times in four plays. One case
only is in war, the others being all connected with Royal or triumphal
processions.</p>

<p>The term is by no means synonymous with Trumpets. The Cornet was an
entirely different instrument, and the use of it accordingly is very
much more limited in these stage directions. There were two
instruments called Cornet, the one with a reed, a coarse sort of Oboe
which was nearly obsolete in the 17th century; the other, with which
we are concerned, a sort of Horn (hence its name), with a cup
mouthpiece, and finger holes for the intermediate notes of the scale.
Hawkins gives pictures of a treble, a tenor, and a bass cornet, copied
from Mersennus, who remarks that the sounds of the cornet are
vehement, <i>but</i> that those who are skilful, such as Quiclet, the royal
cornetist (<i>i.e.</i>, of France, 1648) are able so to soften and modulate
them, that nothing can be more sweet.</p>

<p>Many people now living will remember the Serpent, a large, black,
curly instrument, of thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> wood covered with leather, which helped to
play the loud bass in oratorios, within the last fifty years. This
Serpent was a true Cornet in every respect. It may now commonly be
seen in Exhibitions, Museums, and curiosity shops, for it has been
entirely superseded by the Bass Tuba and the Euphonium.</p>

<p>In the text the word Cornet does not occur.</p>

<p><i>Tucket.</i> Rare, only <i>seven</i> times in six different plays. This is one
of the several trumpet calls we have noticed. It seems to have been a
French term, <i>toquet</i>, or <i>doquet</i>, and this is defined by Littr&#233;, as
<i>quatri&#232;me partie de trompette d'une fanfare de cavalerie</i>&#8212;that is,
the name 'toquet' was applied to the fourth trumpet in a cavalry
fanfare. Mr Aldis Wright, in his Clarendon Press Edition of Hen. V.,
gives Markham, quoted by Grose in 'Military Antiquities,' which
explains 'Tucket' as a trumpet signal, which, 'being heard simply of
itself without addition, commands nothing but <i>marching after the
leader</i>.' Certainly in Shakespeare it seems to be used as a <i>personal</i>
trumpet call&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Merchant</i> V, i, 121, Lorenzo says to Portia,
'Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet&#8212;'<i>i.e.</i>, the 'tucket
sounded' which is indicated in the stage direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> Other cases of
the use of the Tucket are quite similar&#8212;for instance, the return of
Bertram, Count of Rousillon, from war; the arrival of Goneril
(<i>Cornwall.</i> What trumpet's that? <i>Regan.</i> I know't, my sister's:) or
the embassy of &#198;neas. Once it is used to herald Cupid and the masked
Amazons, in <i>Timon</i>; and twice at the entrance of Montjoy, the French
Herald, in <i>Hen. V.</i></p>

<p>The derivation of the word from <i>toccare</i>, and its connection with
<i>tocco di campana</i>, <i>tocsin</i>, and <i>tusch</i>, have already been explained
in the notes on Hortensio's music lesson to Bianca. (See <a href="#II">Sec. II</a>.)</p>

<p>In the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a> is given an Italian Tucket of 1638, and a French one
of 1643.</p>

<p>In the text the word is only found once&#8212;viz., <i>H. 5.</i> IV, ii, 35,
where the Constable of France orders the trumpets to 'sound the
tucket-sonance, and the note to mount,' which fits in with Markham's
definition, for the passage appears to recognise the tucket as in some
sort a <i>preparatory</i> signal.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth noting, that of the seven tuckets in the stage
directions, only one, Goneril's, is supposed to be an English one. In
the single instance just given of its use in the text, it is a
<i>French</i> general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> who uses the word. Perhaps this may be regarded as
confirming the view of its foreign origin.</p>

<p><i>Parley</i>, or <i>Trumpets sound a parley</i>, either alone, or with
<i>Retreat</i>. This call is named in the stage directions 7 times in five
plays, viz.&#8212;<i>H. 6. A.</i> <i>three</i> times; <i>H. 6. B.</i> once; <i>R. II.</i> once;
<i>H. 4. A.</i> once; and <i>H. 5.</i> once. It means either a trumpet call
announcing an <i>embassy</i> from one party to the other, or for
<i>cessation</i> of hostilities during the fight itself. Of course the name
is derived from <i>parler</i>, with a reference to the proposed 'pow-wow'
of the opposing forces.</p>

<p>The notes of a parley do not appear to exist.</p>

<p>[Perhaps a little light may be got out of the symphony to Purcell's
duet in King Arthur, 'Sound a Parley ye fair.']</p>

<p>In the text, the word is used several times. In three cases,
<span title="Transcriber's Note: Added missing scene number"><i>John</i> II, i, 205, 226</span> and
<i>H. 5.</i> III, iii, 2, 'the parle' means the conference of the parties
itself, not the trumpet call summoning them. In the rest, 'parle' or
'parley' simply means the sound of the trumpet, as explained above.
<i>H. 6. B.</i> IV, viii, 4; <i>R. 2.</i> I, i, 192, III, iii, 33; <i>H. 6. C.</i> V,
i, 16; <i>Othello</i> II, iii, 23.</p>

<p><i>Horns</i>, or <i>Horns wind a peal</i>, or <i>Horns winded</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>This is very rare. Seven times in only four plays, one of which is the
doubtful <i>Titus Andronicus</i>.</p>

<p>Three times it is used of hunting horns, <i>Titus</i> II, ii, and <i>Id.</i> l.
10, and in the Induction of the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>; twice as a part
of Lear's lessened state, <i>Lear</i> I, iii and I, iv; once announcing the
Post from England, <i>H. 6. C.</i> III, iii; and once blown by Talbot as a
military signal at the forcing of Auvergne Castle gates, <i>H. 6. A.</i>
II, iii.</p>

<p>The 'peal' of horns referred to in <i>Titus</i> II, ii, 10 is a technical
term in forestry for a particular set of notes on the horn. M&#233;hul
(1763-1817), in his overture 'Le jeune Henri,' introduces several old
French hunting fanfares, which perhaps may give an idea of what was
meant by 'Horns wind a peal.' [See <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.] Also in Purcell's 'Dido
and Eneas,' No. 16 (date 1675), in the scene between the Sorceress and
the two witches who are plotting the destruction of 'Elissa,' at the
words 'Hark! the cry comes on apace,' the violins give an imitation of
a hunting call.</p>

<p>The only instance of the use of the word 'peal' in the text is in the
same passage, <i>Titus</i> II, ii, 5, where Titus tells his hunters to
'ring a hunter's peal.' Here we have a last example of punning on a
technical term of music.</p>

<p>If the lower part was added <i>extempore</i>, it was called Descant, but if
written down as here, it was called Prick-song, because 'pricked'
down. The Plain-song is perhaps more often found in a lower part, the
Descant being higher. From the position of the added part, the above
example is called 'bass' descant.</p>

given in full in Percy's Reliques, Vol. I. p. 180.</p>

<p>This is certainly old, early 16th century. The tune has a striking
likeness to 'Walsingham,' which is the first piece in the Fitzwilliam
Virginal Book. See Percy's Reliques, Vol. II. p. 75. But the date of
the next is not so certain, though probably it is of Shakespeare's
time.</p>

<p>For <i>four</i> voices. The second man comes in at

<p>24. Threeman songs (corrupted into 'Freeman,' see p.
<a href="#Page_83">83</a>). These were
entirely different from Catches. A Threeman song is merely (as a rule)
a song with <i>three parts</i>,&#8212;<i>e.g.</i>, two trebles and a tenor, etc.
<i>Winter's Tale</i> IV, ii, 41, and IV, iii, 285-327.</p>

<p>Here is a Threeman song, published in 1609, but probably much older
than that.</p>

<p>There are two more verses of the same sort.</p>

<p>25. 'Canst thou not hit it,' <i>L.L.L.</i> IV, i, 125. No more words known,
except this one verse.</p>

'Orfeo,' 1608. This at all events must have had a different step to
the Morisque of Arbeau. (See <a href="#ORCHESOGRAPHIE">Note on the 'Orch&#233;sographie.'</a>)</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
